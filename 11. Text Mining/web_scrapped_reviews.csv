0,"Won't take much of your time so I'll dive right in to the review. Comfort wise they are perfect. At least for my ears but I'm pretty sure it'll fit most of you out there. The earphones are made of plastic shells which look sturdy and can resist your usual wear and tear. The cable is also of the decent quality. But none of the things are the selling point of these headphones. KZ promises audio quality and delivers it! These are not your usual ear candy earphones like boat, sony, redmi, realme, etc and if you prefer that sound signature don't buy it. But if you prefer a clean audio with tight bass airy highs these are the headphones for you. The miss are also present but a bit laid back in the mix. I'd rather call them U shaped rather than V shaped. It lets you hear little details in your music you've never heard before. All in all of you want a balanced headphones these should be my pick and I've used literally every earphone under 2k price braket including rha ma390, soundmagic e10c, 1more piston, ath clr100, cx275s and many more and none of them even come close to what sound quality which these provide."
1,"I bought kz zstx qnd wrote review that buds are not that great. To my surprise i recieved comply foam tips for free.
What kind of hospitality is this. I have bought a lot of stuff from several so called e com giants. But i never received any reply even from sellers. Now comes this great website headphone zone. Just with a review they sent me free earbuds. Its still unbelievable for me. Headphone zone. You're the best . And I'm really very very very satisfied now. Thank you Raghav. Your amazing"
2,"Don't let it's neon colours, bad English in it's instruction booklet, etc deceive you, it's a great pair of headphones, I used it with the comply tips which I bought extra, never used the silicon gel tips that came with it. 
The fit is good, the loop keeps the earphone from falling off. It's a snug fit. 
I could hear a lot more song details that my JBL T210 missed.
I used with with my Moto G5s plus, it suits the phone perfectly as a headset with no microphone combatability issues that I faced with my Sony XB 55ap but for me the microphone is poorly placed, it's just above my chest. The microphone is not sensitive enough to take up conversation like the similarly microphone placed skullcandy headsets. The wires are thick weaved ones covered by transparent plastic cases with copperish wires inside. They do feel a bit rugged, will only know it's quality in time. 
Also I feel my phone is underpowered to run these headsets, coz when we plug these to a laptop. We're gonna get some serious outputs from these."
3,"Got these recently from Headphonezone and I have only one word, fantastic!
These headphones may very well be the reason as to why I would never buy a phone without a 3.5 mm jack.
Cheers!"
4,"Thanks to Headphone zone for there honest review and timely delivery.. one of the best reviewer of ep's and hp's.  The kz-zst is one of the best sounding earphones in this price range. Trust me u will not get a better option at this price.. have used more than 15 earphones across all brands but this came in as a surprise.. have extensive research I bought this ep's the Bass and trebel is good... close to balance sound..Also you will be able to hear the small details in the sound signature.which will keep you wondering and will make you go crazy... noise isolation is good..the quality of the earphones are good including the wire but it gets tangled soon.. must watch hd moves very effective while you are watching hd movies
Buy it you will not regret it.. 
Amazing sound 
Details are good
Best buy for your money
Go ahead and order it..
Enjoy ur music the way you love it.. Cheers"
5,"This is my first IEM and it exceeded my expectations. After going through several online reviews I decided to go for ZSTx over Shure SE215, I was not doing wrong. This is just mindblowing. 

Build quality is good, not the best. Made of plastic, the writings on the bottom are slowly fading away after a month's usage. Cable is super flexible and it flexes like a chain, it makes it super tagly. This is the biggest con for me. Everytime I find it tangled when I take out of the case, always a take a minute or two to untagle. 
This IEM fits in my ears very well, it won't fall off as the cable hooks into the ears very well. 
I don't use earphones for calls, but this one has a mic, which is useful if you have the habit of using earphones as your phone's mic. 
Sound  :  
            I am not an audiophile or an expert, I'm just writing what I felt like, My previous headphones were, old Sony MDR cassette walkman headsets, Earpods, Beats Studio Monster, ATH M50X  etc. I've also used Airpods and few JBL, panasonic, Xiaomi headsets. ZSTx is the latest addition to my list. This beats every other models I've ever used. The sound is incredible. I'm using a Redmi Note 7S and a high end gaming PC as my primary audio sources. I've tested this with Mac book pro as well. 
I'm using Poweramp on the phone, with the EQ modded this sounds incredible, with the Mac this was even better without tweaking the EQ. Everything is well detailed,  instrument seperation is very good, sound stage is wide.
  Even though it's mentioned as a V shaped sound, I feel it's bright sounding. Trebles are sparkly and crystal clear. I could hear a lot of stuff which I weren't noticing before with my other headsets. Thanks to the BA drivers.
Mids are clear and good,  
I don't recommed this for bassheads. having said that, there is enough bass and it's punchy, won't dissappoint. 
Overall this IEM is an incredible value for money. Decent build quality, exceptional sound which is super rare at this price point. Actually it's better than many higher priced models. 
Highly recommended."
6,"Having used Fiio F1 earphones before, I had a positive perception of Chinese brands - you get what you pay for, and more, if you pay for the right thing.
So I went for the KZ KST after reading extensively about them online. The KST sound brilliant. I've paired them with my Cowon Plenue D and some of the BBE EQ sound fantastic with these. I also own the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x and while they lean towards a warmer sound, these are more neutral and I can hear details I can't even hear with my Rs 9000 headphones. The bass isn't too good, it sounds a bit thumpy if you really push it with the EQ but that is clearly not the USP of these earphones. For the lower frequencies the M50x have a clear upper hand, but for the detail, its KST all the way.
Another thing of note is that I've NEVER been comfortable with earphones in my ears before - until now! I've been through several pairs of Sennheisers, the Fiio, Sony, Creative earphones but I ALWAYS had ear ache after 20+ minutes of listening. Not so with the KST - they are very comfortable right out of the box.
All in all, staggering value for money.
P.S. I was tempted to think funky and got the candy coloured pair, but now I think black would've been a better choice."
7,Can't bargain for more. You get a 2 driver iem for this low price and more could you expect. Just amazing. I love the feel and comfort they provide. You also get a real nice braided detachable cable. Perfect for everyday use. I just replaced the stock ear tips with Comply Foam tips. Bingo!  That's all you got to do.
8,"Let’s start with the built quality, built quality is ok not very premium but for the price you can’t complain, sound is good V snapped sound signature , it is good for budget phones it worked perfectly on Samsung a50 but when I used it on apple devices iPhone and iPad it worked perfectly till 70% volume but started to fall apart and sound started to crack after 70 on apple devices.
    If someone is looking for a good hybrid earphones under 2k for a budget phone this won’t disappoint."
9,"yeah, buy this. its good"
10,"Being an audio engineer, I have properly used and tested a plethora of earphones and headphones! I was in need for a good IEM, One of colleague suggested to go for the ZSTx; hence I ordered it right away after looking at the affordable pricetag! The shipping was quick and secured. And when I plugged them! BOOM! I was blown away by the result. I have used much expensive earphones before, But I never felt that it costs less than 2k! Just amazing. Highly recommended to get you started!"
11,"It was delivered in time and in perfect condition. Kudos to hz for that.
    Now coming to the iem, they sound much better than my sennheiser cx street II and are also built very well. I'm just a casual listner and i needed something better than my sennheiser. So in that regard, these KZs are decent upgrade. Enough bass, great stereo separation, nice highs but can get lil harsh sometimes. Sound stage and mids are definitely better than cx ii."
12,"Delivery was quick, took just one day.
    The earphones are awesome for the money, great sounding combined with memory form ear tips and fiio amp.
    For the money the earphones are just a steal. 
    initially the fitment in my ear was not that great, used large ear tip and replaced it with form tips, things improved, great sound reproduction.."
13,"Well what can I say, I was sitting there on my balcony admiring the beauty of God's creation as my eyes drifted towards the sunkissed hills that lay beyond, I decided to play some songs to soundtrack the view and took these earphones out.
Well although I had tried these earphones earlier and was somewhat impressed by their clarity, the moment the song 'Into the Mystery' by NEEDTOBREATHE popped up playing I started getting goosebumps... The harmonies were so well set and the soundstage was pleasantly surprising.
The bass sounds much more precise compared to any earphone I had ever tried, I've mostly used Sony xtra bass earphones all my life so I wanted to abandon that bass heavy ship and swim towards clearer waters.
The clarity in these earphones is such a welcoming sound compared to the muddy bass that I had been so used to... And I'm so glad I bought these.
I also am so grateful to the headphonezone team who were really professional in handling the order from the moment I placed then till the moment they arrived. Thanks to the team!
God bless ya'all

14,I'm not received any item from Blue dart courier. How can u generate this mail
15,"I love them,
    The sound is so clear 
    They seem to be durable
    Value for money"
16,"Summary : very good.
Play : had high expectations from the reviews. so immediately after unboxing, applied kumkum on candy-buds and cable! and sure enough they did not disappoint.
Rewind : so 3 weeks ago, after youtube research, i ordered realme buds air 2 TWS, as a replacement for OP bullets 2 wireless. decent. but within 3 days of use, the mic stopped working! still awaiting replacement. on further youtube digging, hit upon 'best earphones under 2000' vid by HZ. serendipity for layman like me who hitherto did not know about HZ. after more research on budget pieces; shortlisted kz zsn pro; but while drooling on HZ for some days, the zsn pro sold out; so ordered zst x before they could dry up.
Forward : after the kumkum, fried these earphones for some hours; and could not wait to pen a review.  liked them very much for my taste of music, which is carnatic fusion, devotional and bollywood. for a layman coming from wired and wireless products of oneplus, boat, jbl, sony and the trusted 15 year old creative ep630 (yes, it still plays), zst x was a good step up.
Notes (punn intended) : dunno if its the 40yrs or just me, but it took 2 hours for proper assembly and plugging in. imagine i used mobile camera to zoom in on the tiny pics in manual to identify L & R and proper in-ear position of candy-buds! naive but reality. L size eartips worked best. ordering with mic was right; in future will help me identify R and L ! cable thin, tangly, vulnerable and candy-buds slippery, imo. no discomfort with in-ear fit for 3+ hours at stretch. 
apple music & jiosaavn from iphoneSE2017, oneplus7 (with typeC to 3.5mm of OP) sound very good. likewise from laptop itunes. separation of instruments is discernable. vocal is crisp but maybe tiny bit subdued by instruments. bass is to my liking viz. just right, no boost no extra. the shimmer of treble also feels right. all this at volume less than 30%! quite good. iam under-qualified to comment on sound sign, frequency response and such, but easily a thumbs up for this zst x. as a bonus, it works well for WFH calls, thanks to the correct mic position.
Pause : absolute VFM. thanks & cheers to HZ ! hope you found my 2 cents helpful.

17,I bought this earphones for playing fps game. And i am not able to play. The directions hearing are awkward. Please make a return. I got the product 2 days back. I am a genuine customer of headphone zone. I have Bought an earphone before also. So please make a return
18,Good
19,Love them!
20,"Quality of the material:  Good quality buds but the texture of the cable is little irritating
Cable: Round and Sturdy. Does not get tangled easily but feels weird. The cable needs to be attached to the ear buds thru small pins. 
Comfort: Ear buds are comfy and they fit securely in your ears however the L and R markings are not easy to locate. Moreover the cable passes around your ear and is little irritating as the cable touches your skin (around your ear). So wearing these buds is a small task itself.
Sound Clarity: AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! 
Bass: Deep and Punchy
Sound stage: AWESOME!!!!!!!"
21,"After using stuff like CX180 for a few years, i decided to go with something different and this seemed to be one of the best intro IEMs available. So i decided to go with this and here's my take after a week of usage -
PROS
1. The highs and mids are quite clear & well defined (because of the BA driver).
2. To put it on and off is something that is a bit difficult for those who are not used to it but once you put it on, it sits firmly and does not cause any pain.
3. Even after prolonged usage (around 4 to 5 hours) i didn't face any discomfort. With my previous earphones, i used to develop quick ear fatigue.
4. This piece is not for people who expect a ""thumping"" ""boomy"" bass sound, the bass is just enough for me because i don't like sound to be very bass dominant.
CONS
5. The cable looks a bit flimsy imo, hope it lasts for sometime at least.
6. The mic quality (though it is decent) could've been improved."
22,"First of all a big thanks to HEADPZ team for the unexpected fast delivery service 👍🏻. I live in Delhi and I’ve received this product within 48hours so, a big plus for that. Secondly, this is my first IEM and i must say its worth every penny. Its comfortable & super light weight, you'll be able to hear most of the details easily but Highs are some how AGGRESSIVE and SHARP (at 70-80% volume) and yes these earphones are louder than any other earphones. Bass is present but not boosted so, stayaway from this product if you are coming from that genre because you won’t be excite after listening to these (Bass enthusiasts go for sony extra bass series). IEM are like that only, even though this particular pair provides impressive BASS structure rather than most of the other IEMs which are known for truly balanced sound signature provides almost flat bass. At the end, i must say I’m impressed of what the KZ ZST X can do in terms of sound and comfort. The music is much enjoyable now. Thanks Headphonezone team."
23,Completely satisfied with the product.clear details and extraordinary product from KZ
24,"I didn't know if such amazing pair of headphones do exist in affordable price range. They give impression of listening in the live concert. Also there is no need of buying accessory earbuds or wires as hyped by a few users. They are complete in themselves. Go for it...👍
    Bravo KZ & Thanks Headphone Zone...🙂"
25,I bought these earphones a week ago and i can say that these are the best earphones in terms of sound quality. These are so beautifully built but the wires.. Tangles a lot. It lacks when it comes to bass. It is the major drawback i faced. So these are good crystal clear earphones but not for bass heads.
26,"I am a hearing-impaired person, lost my hearing ability at a young age. But I love to listening music for over a decade. Music made my ear open and feel the sound of the real world. I have ReSound Hearing Aid, (the parent company of Jabra) around 2 Lakh INR. Before IEM I used to listen to music on a hearing aid, which is Bluetooth connected to a phone. In fear of damaging the expensive hearing aid due to listening to music more time, I decided to buy something like a high-sounding earphone. Your headphone gurus suggested me to go with IEM, and I have no idea what IEM is! Then I search YouTube videos, I found IEM is a great piece rather than average earphones. When I first time play music on IEM, I burst into a tear, that I was like, am I dreaming? I can't believe the sound feel, I can feel every sound type, Bass, Treble, Mids. I have used quite many headphones in my life, but nothing can match the IEM's sound quality. I can't mention noise cancellation, I don't need noise cancellation because I am already deaf, so I can't able hear surrounded sound and noise. So for me, it's a perfect thing! But I can't say this KZ IEM is better than my hearing aid, that will be a comparison between 2K vs 2LK products. I will definitely go with Flagship IEM from the headphone zone after earning some money. Overall, this is the best product ever, I understand why Headphone zone always promotes the best product like IEM rather than shitty and hyped earphones like Mi, Realme, Boat, Apple, etc.
Review: Bass: Punchy and You can feel the difference between bass and treble/mid
              Treble: You can feel a little much treble beat used in music
              Mids: The pure monumental sound experience
This got a dual driver different driver, it's like two different speakers in one earphone.
As being deaf, one drawback I found, while playing YouTube video, it produces less sound. But that problem was solved after adding a sound booster extension in the browser. Because YouTube might limit the sound to control data usage (I am assuming that).
Overall it's IMPRESSIVE!!!!!!!!"
27,"Went through a lot of research before buying this unheard brand. Had no previous experience with IEMs either, but trust me they deliver more than what you pay for. I was also worried about the cable quality. It tangles for sure but is very durable. The earpiece themselves are super comfortable while using them for a long period of time. Once you select a tip size that you're comfortable with and fix both earpieces in your ears, they take you to a different world. Superb noise isolation, audio clarity. This is especially more lucrative to people who like instrumentals and vocals. I found the bass to be sufficient enough while not suppressing other sounds. The wire goes behind your ear and there's no pressure on ears. All in all, would recommend anyone looking for a good earpiece with mic (not very great) at a price of under 2k. Go for it, music lovers."
28,"I have used better sounding earphones at this price point. Also none of the three provided earbud caps fit snug in my ears. I would not recommend them, not worth the hype."
29,Left ear piece stopped working after 8 months of purchase and warranty claims are not even considered after submitting each and every detail. Never coming back to this website again
30,My kz zst x shipped and delivered really fast and before delivery headphonezone were giving timely reply through whatsapp support. After receiving my earphone I checked it and found the wire quality very flimsy and cheap so I checked the product page and found my wire is different from what was advertised. In the review also people have got the advertised wires. So I tried contacting headphone zone from last 5 days for any explanation but hey were not replying. Really very unprofessional customer service. Check my attached photo and look at the different wire types.
31,"NEVER BUY FROM HEADPHONE ZONE
One of the main difference between zst and zst x is its upgraded silver plated cables but I only got the old copper cables. It is so disappointing. The actual earphones are very good. The package also mentioned it has the upgraded silver plated cables but the one included in the box is the old copper cables. Buy with caution.
Edit: No proper customer support. KZ never included copper cables in kz zst x. One of the main difference between kz zst and kz zst x is the inclusion of silver plated braided cables. 
I've checked every kz zst x unboxing even the one that Raghav reviewed has the silver plated cables. The manufacturer website also shows that silver plated cables are included in the box. 
The customer support are saying that you received old stock so you have copper cables the newer stock only has silver plated cables. It was never like that kz zst x only comes with the newer silver plated braided cables. 
They've also included a single photo of the copper cables in the middle of many photos (maybe around 20) and the customer support are telling they have included the photo of copper cables in the product page. 
At this point it's a gamble you may get silver or copper cables for the same price. But I'm sure you will get only copper cables when buying it on 2022. 
Very disgusting that the silver plated cables are sold for 700 which they should include with the earphones. Literally felt bad buying from headphone zone. 
I've paid for the original product and I got it with a really low quality cable. I can't return because it will take another one or two week and who will know again I may get a low quality product. 
The kz zst x is good but headphone zone is bad. Never buy from them don't be fooled by the five star reviews."
32,"The sound is better than my e10c as long as it is working. Some issue with the wire I guess, automatically lowers or increases the volume in all phones I tried. No issue with other earphones. Can't use it for 10 minutes."
33,"This is my first IEM. And I AM not audiophile .But please read the full review.
I share just my experience for this IEM. for reference I have 
very cheap price 300 RS earphone  and amazon music and spotify.
first good things about the earphone - 
Very big sound stage.
Very detailed highs .
vocals are very detailed and natural .
good for old and low res  retro songs.
and here are some cons
first thing I notices the bass has no resolution and very oddly tuned .
It has very good amount of bass but texture and feel of instrument is 
very cheap Bluetooth like. like drums and tabla and dhol   sound worst .
vocals are not detailed and clear bot missing the warmth.
I am also very sensitive to highs, but it very shouty  to instruments 
and for long listing it is not great.
But I am telling very bitter truth that It cant beat my 300 Rs 
earphone in overall sound quality. I sounds stupid but that is 
true . there are some areas were this cheap earphone shines
1. vocals had very good warmth and smooth presentation 
 way ahead then kz zst x.
2 . bass has ton of  resolution and dynamic range and texture .
    It goes very deep also very smooth and without distortion .
   It beats kz zst x in every instrument . 
3. Sounds very lively and and airy .
  and the  very unknown   earphone is mee audio  rx18
 cheap build but amazing sound ."
34,"Updated (17/9/21): got my refund in store credit, thank-you headphonezone.
Now Coming back to my review.
my review for KZ ZST X in one line is => |it sounds like listening to music on crack.|
if anyone is thinking about buying it I will say stay away from it if you are treble sensitive cause these pair will give you ear fatigue because these pairs are damn too loud.I previously owned SoundMagic es18, SoundMagic es18s, JBL C100SI, OPPO enco m31 but none of these pair ever give me any ear fatigue  feeling ever.
Most song tracks sounded muddy with a sharp treble which is fatiguing and can make any type of music very unnatural.
It is not for someone who wants clarity in music. Music feels very artificial on these pair. The only thing that I liked about these pair of earphone are there cables and build quality. 
Clarity -> 2/5.
Bass -> 3/5
Treble -> 2/5(extreme sharp)
Mids. -> 3/5.
Comfort -> 1/5
Cable & build -> 5/5
These earphones are best for edm and rap songs."
35,"As a non audiophile i was made curious about iems and therefore after checking out multiple reviews and videos decided to get a pair of zstx
The design and comfort is good but it seems that the connection point between the earbuds and the cable did feel a tad testy. However, I really loved the way they fit in the ears
I used to listen to 250 rupees earphone on an ipod shuffle before this and i did like the upgrade in clarity of the zstx automatically. The richness is the sound quality is undeniable but i detected this only when I increased the volume above 50% volume.(i majorly listen to popular bollywood,rap,alternative rock like linkin park or metallica like songs and sometimes lo-fi)
 Compared to my previous earphones any setting below 50% on kz zstx felt clearer. Personally, I felt that the chi-fi experience kicks in only if you have good quality music, a quality music player and a good earphones to make a great input-output match. Also i have felt that most reviews are subject to the ears(like how much do they listen to, how sensitive are their ears to the different frequencies) of the listener and therefore this earphone might be a good fit for some and could be a misfit for others. This is where the headphonezone's return policy shines. They have a very good return policy that is fast and reliable. I have returned these earphones,not becasue I did not like them but i wanted a product that provides a more richer experience.(Important to note here is that you can return a product only once if you are unhappy with it). I wish i could try these out before placing an order to be completely sure.I could have avoided the hassle."
36,"I had a pair of Sony MDR-EX155AP before these. I was a bit skeptical about KZ as I had never heard of this brand before. Watched Sumit Sourav's video with Raghav and decided to get these pair. They sound much better than the Sony and in my opinion have a better bass. All in all, it's a great pair of headphones under 2k. The only drawback is they get a bit uncomfortable after an hour or so."
37,"First Thanks to HeadphoneZone for providing such a wide range and top-class service. 
I buy this after hearing a lot about KZ's IEM's that it is equivalent or even better than what we get at 2x or 3x price point so I decided to give it a try. I also use Shure SE215 and definitely, I can tell you it is not as good when compared to the above 3k segments. Here what I think about kz ZST X:
Build Quality: Good build quality, resin body looks durable with silver-plated cables which looks sturdy but the downside is its microphone (flimsy microphone). 
Fit: Stock ear tips won't provide good isolation for my ears. I have some extra foam tips so I replaced the stock one with foam ear tips and now it fits perfectly.
Sound: Somewhat Balanced with a little bright. After replacing with foam ear tips I observed the right amount of bass and mids but uneven treble performance. Sometimes there is too much detail and brightness in already bright tracks which ultimately suppress the lows and mids. But the best part of ZST X is it has excellent imaging. Soundstage is SO SO. Overall you get the right amount of bass and mids with little extra trebles, good sound clarity & separation with a decent soundstage.
Comfort: Very comfortable.
Conclusion: Taking price into consideration it is worth buy under the 2k-3k segment with hybrid technology, but if you want warmer sound then take BLON BL-03 into consideration.
Over the top ""Talk to a GURU option"" is something pretty impressive Ian from HeadphoneZone suggests KZ zsn pro x, I tried it (one of my friends has) but it won't fit in my ears so I choose ZST X over this. Anyway thanks for the suggestion. Overall a good experience from the HeadphoneZone again."
38,"I own the HifiMan Sundara, I will use them as a reference guide so to say, while they don't have a flat sound signature, they're more flat than anything else that I have owned. I'm using both on a Focusrite Scarelett Solo.
First of all if you're into Bass, the ZST X got you covered, they're pretty strong, sometimes too strong in my opinion, they muddle the mids quite a bit on a bass heavy track, mids are clear most of the time, nothing to complain about really. The Highs can be really sharp sometimes as in the cymbals, claps, etc. From my perspective they have more of a V Shaped sound signature rather than Balanced. Overall amazing value for the money, if you're going to spend less than Rs. 5,000, get these with a DAC/AMP combo or just get a DAC and start saving for the AMP. You don't need an AMP that is for sure. To get the same kind of output volume from the KZ ZST X as my Sundara, I only had to put the volume knob at half of what the Sundara needed. Once you get into Rs 10,000 and more you can choose something else imo. It would be an amazing gift for those friends and family that still use the included headphones from their phones.
Value 10/10
Sound 7.5/10
Build Quality 8/10
Overall 8.5/10"
39,Ordered these KZ-ZSTX its supposed to be get delivered with silver braided cables but i received a cheap quality plastic cable and when i talked with Headphone zone they are not accepting their mistake instead they have changed the description and images and when i asked them for exchanged instead of exchanging the wire they are giving me refund in STORE CREDIT (the hell am i going to do with it) which is useless.
40,The jack becomes loose after a while and the earbuds are loose also ... Worst quality
41,"So glad that I bought the KZ ZST-X as my first pair of IEM's.. Am in love with them since day one. 
    Here is my full review on YouTube: https://youtu.be/biUC9sfMDpA"
42,it's mentioned that there is silver platted wire with this headphones on the box front but i was disappointed when i received the copper wire and the box was completely packed .it's seems to be fake to me now
43,"1. service by headphone zone
     great service provided by headphone zone
    be it talking with headphone guru
    or talking about correction in pincode
    (5 star for it)
2. about kz
    i had never heard such sound quality earlier
3. over all nice experience
    (if they had provided silicone tips
    it would be 10 stars 🤩)

... "
44,Kz zst x is suitable for everyone yeah they do lack a bit when it comes to bass but that doesn't mean it can't produce bass I loved the amount of bass produced when required it is more diverted to people who falls in love with treble and treble on kz zst x is just amazing for the price I am giving it a 4 out of 5 coz they do lack a bit of comfort for long Lasting sessions.
45,"The Earphones are really great and are value for money, I use them while going to sleep and they never cause me any discomfort. The cable provided is prone to tangle but is very good. I would not recommend it to anyone who is a rough user but if you take care then they are an awesome pair of earphones for everyday and the mic quality is also good. I also use this for gaming and it is good too and is certainly better than most gaming headphones. Some users may need to tweak the EQ like me to get a sound profile that they like but overall I feel they are better than many products in the same price range available at alternate earphones. I would also like to add that the website is very good. This was my first purchase and had used COD to be on the safe side but I would like to say the service is excellent and delivery times are very good although I would like to mention that if you use COD , club audiophile points may not reflect but raising a ticket and resolution was both quick and professional. Overall I am impressed with both the product and website and look forward to buying more products in the future.
tl;dr Impressed with both the product and website"
46,"This is my first ever IEM. Before talking too much one thing i can assure that this worth its price. But dont expect too much seeing other reviews. Basically I am not a fan of V shaped sound signature but as my budget was too short i found this as a best choice. 
1. Build : Even though the material is plastic it doesnt feels like its going to break so fast. So u can use without fear. The cables are also very good and easy to use. Once you get the right fit u can dont have to bother about the cables. And yes it looks so cute as a candy.
2. Sound : After reading so many great review i was expecting a mind blowing sound. TBH, it didnt  blow my mind in first few hours but later i eventually started loving it. Especially the base. It literally blown my mind. The base was so detailed and it has the punch but not too heavy for the ears like in boat earphones. Highs are also detailed but not as good as the base portions. Mids feels so shy but in a v shaped signature i think that has to be expected (Using EQ it can managed to an extent). 
Cons :
For me the major negative in terms of sound is that it lacks soundstage and imaging. But more that that what i feels as defect is that i cant use this for more than two tracks without taking a break. My ear gets tired very fast even when the sound is below 25 percent volume. I first thought the problem is with my ears but i was okay with using 1more piston fit classic and mi basic earphones."
47,"Firstly I want to mention that the silicon buds that come with this are the worst they are giving a irritation feeling to my ears after 20 min listening...
    And  The sound quality is beyond my expectations for this one .And the sound seperation are also very good you can feel while you are listening This is do good job for the beginner audiophile as they said .Bass is also okay .. But definitely not for the bassheads ...
    My only regret for this buy is the silicon ear buds"
48,"I just bought Kz zst x cause of its positive reviews and sound signature. But it's too big and earbuds are not comfortable at all .Sound is amazing but can't wear them for more than 10 minutes, it starts to pain and very rough feeling ..  I am currently using oppo enco m31, It's super comfortable but kz Zst x are not ..😌"
49,"Just received earphones few days back, ordered it after impressive 2nd day delivery of RHA 390 I had ordered earlier, the same speed was seen in this delivery too.
About the earphone, dy are good, definetly captures all the instruments playing and space separation of instruments playing can be felt, the sound is slightly sharp . Overall a good purchase for the price point"
50,"Headphonezone delivery is nice and fast, but KZ - ZST X is not good headset I need to return it can you help me."
51,"I didn't expect the zst x to sound anywhere close the way they actually sound. I'm not an audiophile but i do have a wide range of headphones and earphones from beyerdynamics to RHA etc at my disposal and this pair can easily match earphones that cost a lot more. 
PROS:
1) Wide soundstage
2) Good instrument separation 
3) Good Vocal separation 
4) Good balanced bass
5) Price!!!
CONS:
1) Need to tune the EQ to get most out of the sound - sound starts distorting after a certain threshold so work it accordingly."
52,I wan to exchange my product
53,The looks is good. Delivery was awesome. But the sound hurts my ears. Not happy with the earphone.
54,"decent comfort, good design, great sound."
55,"Well to be honest. One of the best earphones i have tried in  the price bracket of under 2000rs. And i have tried many including e10c, enco m31,ma390 etc. Sound quality is really good They are very detailed and the base is not over whelming but sufficient to enjoy the music played. You are able to hear each and every instrument that is played they dont sound very technical if you understand what i mean to say. The only downside for me  was they are on the brighter side which im not used to ie the treble is sparkly. Due to low impedance the power needed for them to drive is really low .volume of 6-8 on my laptop is sufficient for them to be loud enough."
56,Sounded good for my liking. It is working well despite my rough use.
57,In this earphones FLAC format music is Awesome
58,I have been using this earphone for close to one year now and to be honest the sound quality will just blow your mind. The lows are good and do not overpower the mids and highs. The mids and highs are also very clear and instruments can also be heard very clearly. I also own Sony WF-1000XM3s and the sound quality of KZs is almost equal to those and actually somewhat better. For your information the Sony XM3s costs around Rs. 14000 which is far costly compared to the KZs but still the sound quality of KZs I would say is better. Its lame to compare  wireless to wired earphones but still I mentioned to give a perspective of what these earphones deliver at such an affordable price point. I would say just go for it if you have never used high end wired earphones. But make sure to listen from a sound source which gives Hi-Res lossless audio to enjoy these earphones to the fullest and use an external dac if possible. I use an Apple DAC since I own a iPad and use Apple Music.
59,"Thankyou Headphone Zone for my first IEM 🤩
Disclaimer: This is not the product review itself. I'll do that at a later time, this is the shopping experience I had while ordering the product itself.
1. There are no KZ foam tips in stock🥲, please restock. I would also love to see an option right beside the mic and without mic option for foam tips. Foam tips make the listening experience better so many might find it useful.
2. I've ordered the product on 26th Feb and I don't live in a major city so 2 day delivery was expected and It was supposed to be delivered on 28th of Feb. The product started in Hyderabad which is in the neighbouring state so I was pretty sure it will reach me in 2 days but it went to Chennai which is also a neighbouring state of mine so I was fine with it. But next day it went to Delhi, WHAT? I was confused like why did go to Delhi I'm no where near Delhi, I was so confused. The product was in Delhi on 28th Feb which was the expected Delivery date, I wanted to contact the customer service but they couldn't have been of much help cause it was a weird situation. On 1st Mar it reached Hyderabad and On 2nd Mar it reached my home town and was delivered. Why did Bluedart give a trip around India to my product, I don't get it , why?
Anyway it reached me and I'm loving it.
People might say why don't you complain to Bluedart, why are doing it here? For them, Do you actually think Bluedart care about a small product I've ordered? No, they don't. 
But I think Headphone Zone could do something like give regular updates during the delivery period along with the updates during the Ordered and delivered time.
That's the only reason for giving 4 star."
60,As a casual music listener these are major upgrades. Design is attractive but plastic is not very reliable. Expressive sound quality. Nice cables too.
61,"Decent audio quality, but the design is not suitable for daily use not at all pocket friendly"
62,"READ THIS IF YOU WANT AN HONEST REVIEW
I am writing this after about 3 months of usage. 
I have both KZ ZXT X and Blon B3, so if you are confused between these two, just go with the KZ (Trust me)
There is nothing to complain about since KZ is just perfect within its price range, no one can provide a better product at this price. 
The only thing which I didn't like is that it's not an Indian brand, we want such products made in India, but this isn't the place for that discussion.
Regardless of its price, here are a few things which I have noticed 
1> The cable is not tangle-free
2> That's it"
63,"Am not an so called audiophile. Previously I've used budget Sony, Sennheiser, Piston fit earphones. While surfing the headphonezone website got to know about the IEMs. Ordered this as per my budget. It's a completely different ball game. The small details in the instrument seperation.......I haven't noticed with my previous earphones. The base is adequate. Overall a great buy. Thanks Headphonezone."
64,"Great IEMs, Build quality is good. Had great experience unboxing these, Thanks Headphone Zone."
65,"This is my first IEM and oh boy my favourite artists already sound so good, it's unreal I was missing out on such a revolutionary product for so cheap, would definitely recommend this to beginner audiophiles, and great delivery service by headphone zone, good to see all my favourite classic rock songs on their curated song lists which comes with the delivery package, just wish they listed a few metal songs there ;)"
66,"This is my first foray into more Audiophile oriented earphones (now IEMs), and MAN! am I Blown or What!
I feel the sound signature is on the flatter side and I love it. I'm coming from Boat/Sony/1-more universe and the vocals on these are just so prominent and clear. The bass is crisp and tight, these are not overly Bassy and it's a good thing IMO. I like the less boomy but crisper Bass of ZST X than the 'Bass Bleed' commercial earphones on Amazon. At the same time, the Bass is no less, Mind You.

... "
67,"IDk.. WRITING THIS REVIEW TO CHECK IF I GET MY 100 POINTS ON WRITING REVIEW , BUT LOOKING FORWARD TO BUY KZ DQ6 VERY SOON..."
68,"Bought these headphones a week back. After connecting the wires with the individual earpieces(L with L and R with R), no sound was coming off the right earpiece. However when i exchanged them (L with R and R with L), it worked fine. This just raises concerns about the durability of the product, as other aspects can go wrong in a month or to. Other than that, everything advertised about the device is absolutely correct. I was blown away by the balanced sound and the clarity of instruments. One should just buy it out of curiosity to listen to all your favourites songs differently."
69,"Got the cyan, mic version for 1600, this was my first IEM and when I heard it for the first time I thought I just wasted my money over some fancy candy, It was too harsh but then i realised that i was so used to the bad over boosted bass that i could not appreciate the accurate sound, after burning for 20 hours on white and pink noise I tried them again and finally got used to the signature after wome time and its totally worth the money. Don't expect the realme, boat type of sound this is different. It will take time to get adjusted but it will be worth it. This will let you hear things that you never noticed with previous earphones. Detailing and instrument separation is excellent as much as i know. And the aesthetic look 👌"
70,"I've previously used lots of ""name brand Earphones"" like Sennheiser cx213, Jbl c200si, etc and trying these with Some hi-res FLAC files was a next level experience. The clarity is immaculate. Every little detail in the track is rendered with utmost precision. And the lows are well defined and don't leak on to the mids. The highs are pleasant and not too shrill.  Instrument Separation is average but miles ahead of non enthusiast generic earphones. Its unfair to expect mind blowing spaciousness in the sub 2k price segment anyway. Overall, very satisfied with the sound quality. The in-box eartips could've been better though. Durability is yet to be seen and these kZs are best handled with care, according to reviews."
71,"V shaped sound signature makes it really fun to listen to strong bass which is well controlled. At this price point, the sound stage and separation is amazing. 
    Would definitely recommend."
72,"Thanks Headphone zone for super fast delivery!
    The sound is clean. Equipped with upgraded silver-plating wire, it provide the transparency, separation and make the sound bottom crystal clear, the voice and instruments more beautiful and beautiful. Ear-hook design keeps earphones in place and cables out of the way for unmatched, long-wearing comfort. One thing could be better if Headphone zone provides a complementary earphone case as other websites are doing the same."
73,"Mind blowing performance at this price range.. probably better or equal to some high end brands. Was little hesitant buying this chi-fi brand but this blew my socks of.. I have used this for few months now.. very comfortable on the ears.. Go for it eyes closed, you wont regret it. The bass is just perfect and can listen for long hours.. and the clarity on this is awesome.. 5 stars from me considering the price range"
74,"KZ is known for budget IEMs. This ZST x from KZ has very crips and analytically detailed decoding capability which surprised me for its price tag. I can feel the drum membrane and the guitar Strings in my ears. And hey, it's is transparent, it that's the in thing these day!!!"
75,"The earphones are definitely a value for money, they deliver everything at its best in this price segment. The sound quality, soundstaging, Bass and the instrumentals on these IEM are top notch. 
But there is a problem with the build of these earphones which is the only reason  I didn't give this a 5 star. the problem is that the cables are detachable which is not a problem itself because I have used various earphones with detachable cable, the problem is that they easily get disconnected like for eg if you put earphone in your pocket in my case they definitely will be detached, it could be a serious problem because in a hurry when you put the earphones in your pocket you may lose the buds 🥲.This could be a problem only for me maybe I may have  received a defective product. 
Otherwise the product is a beast."
76,"Damn i was skeptical at first but after getting these i am totally astonished after listening, they sound phenomenal, the bass is heavy and goes deep and crystal clear treble and not harsh it's just enough for every consumer. I am using it with a USB C to 3.5mm adapter which has built in DAC for my OnePlus 7T Pro. They are awesome.
    Thanks a lot headphone Zone for the products that surprise us"
77,"I've used them for over a month, and they're great.
Before I write my review, I wanted to say that these IEMs take time, don't conclude in one or two days. Instead, as you keep listening, the sound opens up, and then you'll like it.
Although it has a V shape sound signature, it is overall a bright, neutral-sounding IEM
The bass here is perfect; it's neither boosted nor lacking. Sub-bass is clean and easy to hear. It has a fast transient response, so kickdrums and beats sound quick and fast. However, it doesn't sound boomy like that. I'm a huge fan of the bass in these. There's a lot of detail.
The midrange here isn't very recessed, but it's not laid back either. They're clean and detailed. The vocals are forward and pleasing, so there's little sibilance, but it doesn't sound harsh at all. So female vocals sound great. Vocals that sound deep, leaning towards the mids, can sound good but lack presence and fullness. It's fun to listen to rock or instrumentals on these because they sound so airy and transparent, not compressed. In busy mixes, they also don't sound muddy, but they can sound harsh and fatiguing in those situations.
My favorite part is the treble. It does not sound smooth at all. It also has peaked in the 5k and 8k range, but it is not harsh or tiring. Thus, it makes the treble sound sparkly, tight, and exciting by adding the upper frequencies. However, it is a good length.
The soundstage and imaging are amazing. They are not just sided by the side, but also forwards and backward. Positioning is good, and imaging is accurate.
I think this is an amazing iem, I can't tell whether it will be good for bass heads, but if you want something that sounds natural and fun, these IEMs are perfect."
78,"These are great pair of budget IEMs and for people just starting their audiophile journey.
    Balanced sound signature is great as it works with most music genres so you will have a great experience with them."
79,"This is the first time that i've bought an IEM, i was really skeptical with it's country of origin and other quality issues.
With that being said, This KZ ZST X is literally the best purchase i have ever done in earphones/headphones.
It has some next level clarity, each and every single instrument can be heard and that too with quite distinction. 
It has real aggressive bass but only when needed, and as an ex bass head, my bass hunger is fully satisfied with it's bass output.
 Now coming to treble, it has that sharp ear treble which in my opinion can be too overwhelming at times, with proper EQ settings you can get what you want from these budget friendly IEMs.
So far i've noticed it's 2 shortcomings, it's vocals isn't its forte and the other i've mentioned earlier.
they have upgraded the cable from the previous ZST, this cable is nice, soft, almost tangle free, and if im not wrong it's silver cable.
I play csgo quite religiously, and it just nails the footsteps in videogames. i've never heard clarity in csgo earlier.
im planning to buy one good quality DAC AMP to take further it's sound quality and clarity.

80,"Chi-Fi excellence reimagined.
KZ has done a great job in bringing a pair of high quality IEMs to the sub-2000 rupees category. The 2 drivers in each earphone deliver the highest of frequencies with ease and bass enthusiasts will not be disappointed as they deliver pronounced bass. Hotel California, Choo Loon by The Local Train and Bohemian Rhapsody are the go to tracks for testing and these earphones have performed very well in bringing out details in all 3 tracks. 
Posting a picture of these on social media brought curious questions to my DM asking details about the product as most people have never experienced a pair of IEMs.
Upon researching online I tuned my Galaxy S9's equaliser(setting all frequencies at -4db in Custom profile and Dolby Atmos off) allowing the inbuilt DAC to bring out more details as I could hear electric guitars and cymbals more pronounced than before.
The in-line microphone is quite clear and loud.
Shoutout to Headphone Zone's prompt delivery in the current state-oriented lockdown as I received the earphones in 3 days through Bluedart. Every package comes with a set of multiple genre suggested playlist cards which you can scan on the Spotify app. 
Issue: The speaker's outlet which sits in your ear canal is broader than your normal pair you earphones and an hour of listening develops ear fatigue thus making it uneasy for you. The factory eartips don't do a good job as they are thin which is why I have ordered a set of KZ foam eartips from Amazon. Foam eartips solve the problem of ear fatigue across all earphone/headphone type, ALWAYS!
I am a proud and happy owner of my first set of IEMs. Detailed music from now on."
81,"The sound is pretty good and clear,  well-balanced overall. The cable on the left ear keeps coming out of the earpiece repeatedly however. Its a bit a hassle since I can very well lose them in a public place. This only seems to happen when I am taking them out though, they are pretty secure as long I am wearing them."
82,"I bought this earphone based on online reviews. But I didn't like the sound. There's no bass, only treble. Sound quality is like cheap local earphone. Waste of money................"
83,"After 4 months of digging ,finally made a decision to purchase KZ. Was earlier using JBL Live 100.
    Very happy with the decision
    Did a voracious research and finally figured out these.
    The sound clarity is of Audiophile grade.
    Build quality is mind-blowing .
    Very comfortable fit 
    Microphone is also good.
    Thanks KZ and Headphone Zone, guess you made a loyal customer to your products.

... "
84,"I've been using this earphone for about a 6 months I feel that its nothing short of excellent in this price range.
I have used many other headphones in this price range including some popular ones like RHA MA 390 and I feel that KZ ZST X  is the better option.
The build quality is amazing . The earbuds can initially feel a little large but once you get used to it, the fit becomes perfect and does not hurt ears.
The cable quality is good, (but rough handlers like me have to little careful). The build quality is miles better than RHA MA 390 . Cables do get tangled but not that much.
When it comes to sound quality
1. This earphone is amazing for guitars or acoustic songs
2. Bass is not like what you get to hear on the Sony ones but its apt - nothing more nothing less . You can always tweak with equalizers to get desired results. However I always stick to the default sound signature of the earphone and it never disappoints. I always miss the Sony's when I'm in the mood for listening bass heavy songs
3. The sound is not up to the mark for unplugged songs or songs with heavy piano and string instruments, somewhere it lacks that crisp and it feels little flat to hear.  Still it's wayyy better than most of the earphones in this price range. People who listen to old songs, you will have a great time with this.
Since, a lot of smartphones are not offering headphone jack we have to use a converter. I use a local converter cable for my oneplus 8T. Sound quality does dip but it does sound good for me, way better than using wireless ones in the same price range. How ever some phones especially realme pnes (with headphone jack) and Laptops offer rich music experience and quality and it sounds amazing.
However for even better results, use a good quality converter cable for your phones.
To sum it up, I do not regret buying this earphone even in this booming wireless earbuds era and it's a good buy. If I have to rate it I would give a 9 on 10.
I thank Headphone zone for bringing this product to India at a great price with an amazing service and timely delivery."
85,"First of all, it’s just not about the headphones, it’s also about the device that you use to play music. I used three common devices to test these headphones- a Redmi K20 Pro smartphone, a Samsung Galaxy tablet with Dolby Atmos and a MacBook Air. 
Though the Redmi K20 Pro smartphone boasts of a built-in DAC, I played my music using a V-shaped equalizer(which is my preference) but it seemed to produce a dampness in the output. Using these with a MacBook Air produce a much better sound. The highs, mids and lows sounded clear and audio quality seemed richer as compared to the quality of music I experienced on my smartphone. The reverberations produced are beautiful. However, I was completely blown away when I used the headphones on a Samsung Galaxy tab using the built-in Dolby Atmos profile with no separate equalizer. I heard sounds in my songs which I hadn’t heard before, like the orchestra opened up in my ears(if you listen to instrumentals and EDM music). 
Build quality- Pretty strong. The wires are well-designed but may get tangled if rolled. The transparent design of the encasing looks awesome. The diaphragm seems heavy but thanks to the curvy design of the wires near them, they never fall out of ears. 
 I have tried Sennheiser CX180, SoundMagic ES series, JBL, Skullcandy, Boat but KZ ZST X have become my new favorite now.
For Headphonezone Team- Kudos to your excellent packaging. Keep up the good work!"
86,"What an output music.....either paired with Smartphone/ Feature phone/ Music Player...Exceptional
Also the way it sits in ear is very comfortable...did not feel the fatigue of hearing music even after 2-3 hours of continuous listening.
Highly recommend this product due to its sound output and prompt delivery by HZ........"
87,"Very good sound stage and detail. Go for it , it's better than most of those branded earphone out there which costs around 5000Rs to 6000Rs"
88,"Disclaimer – the opinion is entirely mine and subjective. This doesn’t mean that other brands are not good.
I was trying to find a good pair of IEM's for my ipod shuffle, and recently I got to know about these pairs in a headphonezone’s youtube video. then i started looking at other reviews as well and i was pretty much convinced to buy them because i found not a single negative review about them, after a lot of thinking and decided to buy them and man they exceeded my expectations. They worth even 3x the money. I am no audiophile but previously i have owned and used a lot of earphone some of which were. sony xb55ap( damn good for bass heads), soundmagic es18-pl11-pl21-e10c, creative ep630( the first branded pair I bought), jbl t120, sennheiser cx180-275( great but highs not clear enough), some of the skullcandies(didnt liked them at all, overrated) some of the boat( overattedddddd), sony xb450, shure se215, RHA MA650(My favourites) wired and wireless, Audio technica M50X Wired and wireless both( The best ever), Vmoda crossfade wireless (hard hitting and versatile), Xiaomi dual drive pro earphones, realme buds. MI sports Bluetooth earphnes, some samsung provided AKG ones and a lot more as well. The main motive behind me listing them here is that i can write a detailed review and you can get an idea about them. Now here comes the review.
Style and build (Rating – 10 out of 10)  – They are second to none in the style department, the silver twisted cable looks awesome, dual colour looks damn great, unusual design but that makes it stand out from the crowed. They are big but they are very comfortable in wearing. The main earphone housing, is made of plastic and feels quite strong, but still I would recommend that don’t toss them around here and there, just use with care. Cable is detachable, this is amazing at this price range. So kudos to KZ in this department. 
Volume level (Rating – 10 out of 10) – These are the loudest pair of all the earphones I have ever tried. That is may be because the impedance is only 12ohms. They are really loud and you cant listen them to even 75% volume let alone full, I used them at 50% of my ipod shuffle volume, and when I say they are loud, believe me they are capable of going to the extremes in volume levels, that will be good when you use a device which has low volume. 
Soundstage ( rating – 7 out of 10)- I cant even explain what kind of soundstage they have. at this price range, you cannot even expect half of what they actually deliver, there is enough depth in the soundstage they feel airy and wide, though not as wide as RHA MA650 wired, but I actually like the depth of KZ. Instrument separation is way better than some of the best earphones like RHA MA650 wired, shure SE215. they are very detailed, but because of the detailing, some people who have never used a really good and expensive pair of IEM, may find them uncomfortable because they have kind of aggressive tuning, which is by no means comfortable for people who are only used to V shape sound signature. 
Bass (Rating – 8 out of 10) – here more rating doesn’t mean more bass, it’s the quality and the feel of the bass. Bass is tight and punchy, yes it is a bit emphasized in my opinion but doesn’t hinders the other frequencies. They are, by no means at Sony xb55ap level, but I didn’t liked the bass on them because at times it was way overpowering the other frequencies but it is not the case with ZSTx. You will definitely enjoy the bass. 
Vocals ( Rating – 6 out of 10) – I have rated them only 6, it is by no means bad at all, don’t consider that the vocals are not clean or bad, it’s just that vocals are really clean, they have a little bit of weightage to them which is good, but they are a bit forward and sounding very near to my ear, I like a little bit of distance in vocals and they are a little upfront sounding for me. This doesn’t mean it is bad, they are very clear and clean.
Treble ( Rating 7 out of 10 ) – with low rating again I don’t mean that it is bad… Highs and treble is a little bit on the recessed side, that just what I think, by no means they lack the highs, they are definitely there and I can say even better than Shure SE215 but not as good as RHA MA650. But I think they are very clean because of Balanced armature. Not sibilant at all. And its enjoyable. But you can feel that they are a bit recessed while listening to Rock, alternative.. 
Overall rating ( 9 out of 10) – At this price point, I don’t have even a single complaint, they look good, they are built good. They sound extraordinarily awesome way beyond my expectation; they are damn good when it comes to the sound. Perfect for almost every kind of genre.  If you ask for my advise, I would suggest you to buy the with the closed eyes. They have just killed the competition in this price range, I just couldn’t think of any pair under 5000 in wired category which can beat them. just buy them they will exceed your expectations too."
89,Excellent sound. I had a fiio triple driver IEM worth 8k. These sound better than that! But they have cut corners in other segments like the wire is very cheap and it pushes the volume to max during a call this usually happens due to bad build in the connector. So be prepared to use some other cable.
90,"I have not yet expected this much pristeen and sufficient bass in my budget under 2k, I really got fully satisfied by this earphones. These are very comfortable for daily use and we can carry anywhere, the built quality is superb with light weight.
I am not an audiophile but I am a music lover, these earphones are enough for the biginers, some people said in review that bass is not sufficient but it's very balanced and presteen, every instrument we can hear clearly, I used many other brands like Senneheiser, Sony, Sound magic, Bayer dynamic and RHA but in this budget these are highly recommendable, heart fully you can go for it, it doesn't disappoint you, you can enjoy high quality loud audio.
I purchased many earphones from headphone zone, they are really doing a great service to the customer, I claimed my warranty for RHA S500 after using two years, I got new one and they did great service. Thank to the headphone zone team, you are very trustful. Coming to the delivery, you are excellent more than Amazon prime delivery, I got it through Bluedart within 48 hours, it's really surprising me the way you are serving to the customer with as and when updates. The parking is also superb.
I love music and trust only headphone zone because they sell only genuine products and the headphone Guru's are working with honesty towards customer interests when they are confused to purchase headphones.they suggest good one according to our budget and interest.
Thank you 🙏"
91,"Was looking for something that isn't as bass heavy as generic headphones. For the price, a really great pair of headphones, right from the looks, to the sound quality. The braided cable feels very robust and of a very good quality.
The only con I'd say for these is the way you put on the headphones. Even after over a month of use, it still takes time to put these on.
Barring that, a really great pair of headphones."
92,KZ - ZST
93,"One line - Buy this while the stocks last.
Detailed review
This is Hi-fi with great mobility, think a headphone like a dt770 80Ω you need an amp to get some juice out of that headphones, but what the ZST can do that the 770 can't is it can be played by a measly smartphone, laptop and still give you output that is close to 75% of what the 770 can, First 2 days didn't like how they sound bass was too much and in my first listen treble gave me a mild headache, It's all gone now ! .The ZST has really good clarity, 
1- Bass is good enough that it can be felt and not muddy either but not controlled at certain frequencies it does over power but that is not all the time.
2 - Mids are there but not the very best but you won't complain either it's flat and life like not larger than life. 
3 - Highs are amazing piano, cymbal crash, string instruments all sound fantastic. 
My thoughts
You would've never heard sounds like these before if come from a budget oriented headphone, Sure KZ struggles in male voices a little bit, female vocals are better, I have used it for a week now, from my testing i have been hearing rock, EDM, Jazz, Blues , some classical, Bollywood, Kollywood I can safely say, this has been an eye opener and an amazing experience, keeping everything aside you needn't cross 50% of your volume in your phone if you sit in your room with the fan on !. 
It has made me like blues more, classical a little bit more, sound stage in some recording feels really wide it gets out of the ear canal and plays.
For this price I don't know if you can find a product like this, easy to drive and this good sounding.
Look at the pictures the candy variant looks amazing, atleast to me, don't know how long the cable will last, but it's not cheap either for the asking price you can't go wrong with this pair of IEMs, sound leakage is also well contained at 70% volume nothing leaks (good for the office). 
It is also source centric, 128kbs sounds horrible and you can tell it immediately, Flac, Cd mp3, m4a  good.
Still can't believe a product like this exsits at this price bracket , do try this.
Thank you Headphone Zone for importing this wonderful piece of equipment."
94,Fair for the price range
95,"I found the earphones value for money. Have been using it regularly for almost 9 months now. Listen to various genres from hard rock to classical music and it has never disappointed me. Sound can be a little bit sharp on high volume especially for high treble and can be irritating. But that's perhaps the only weakness of this earphone. Mic is an additional advantage. 
They're relatively tangle free and the wire is durable too. The transparent casing of the earphones is eye catching and so is the audio-monitor style. Comfortable for long hours of usage without any ear pain. Does not cancel out ambient noise, despite that it's great. Can be used during commute, workouts, video calls or just listening to music."
96,If you are an audiophile with less than 2k budget close your eyes and go for this.
97,nice
98,"Excellent Quality in little range, suggested to buy"
99,Withing one month mere 1500rs ke headphone damage ho gaye .. And according Worrenty company ko headphone karna tha.. But company ne replace kr ke nahi diya... 😒
100,"I have got KZ ZSTX and on first listening to music on my phone (without any additional DAC), the depth and surround effect of the sounds captured my attention. 
Each Instruments, background voices, leading voice.etc are properly staged and separated. Even on low volumes you can hear each instruments as well as background voices.
It feels like you have a 5.1 Surround speakers set up arround you, but much better.
Bass is not boosted, but gives adequate deep bass (that vibrations), which can be easily boosted with an equalizer.
As opposed to some comments in youtibe videos, where they complain that treble is ""harsh"", I would say that KZ might have corrected it, because the treble feels smooth and doesn't sound harsh. Clarity is amazing and doesn't hurt my ears.
So far I'm still testing the IEM. For better quality, I would recommend to use FLAC music or 160+kbps opus or 320kbps MP3 or 256kbps AAC.
Some high quality (paid version) of online music streaming service are good, but YouTube music feels good even if not premium."
101,great IEMs for literally everything
102,After years of using the same type of headphones that would break off or get damaged within some months of use i stumbled on headphone zone on YouTube and decided to buy these headphones they are superb
103,"If this is your first time buying an iem, dont hesitate just buy it. This one has that typical v-shaped sound like every other entry level iems but tuned in a good way. The sound is surprisingly somewhat balanced with no overpowered bass & harsh treble like other KZs. Vocals are also quiet good for the price range. These iems have really enjoyable consumer grade sound signature suitable for hearing all kinds of music. These iems are not that much heavy in weight and quiet comfortable for the price. The eartips are not bad but upgrading with a better eartips will greatly improve sound quality and comfort. Playing with different types of eartips will show you a huge difference in sound signature. The cable quality is also good. Overall verdict: Dont hesitate, Just start your iem journey here."
104,This product is worth buying
105,"Pros:
    -Durable design
    -Great sound
Cons:
    -Slightly bulky
    -silver plated cable gets detached easily"
106,"These are so lightweight, you can't feel that you're carrying them. Very very comfortable..and the sound is perfect! You'll discover parts and sounds in a song you didn't even know existed. Go for them..best IEMs under budget.
    Just know that kZ has gone towards c type cables for IEMs..so if this cable gets damaged..replacement wouldn't be possible (or rather very difficult)."
107,"I'm not a serious audiophile, I'm a what you call an average audiophile who likes his music clean and rich. First things first, they come out of the box and you listen to them and aren't put into an awe, rather you feel a weird sense of the plain in which these earphones play. If you connected them to your average phone, it will pick up the voltage diffrence on it and that's just crazy! These beautiful sound producing devices will ask you to up your game to a DAC for starters, and you know they are built really well. I connected them to my 18 year old iPod Nano and let me tell you with a little bit of equalising,you can't get any better at this or even double it's price range.
I'm looking forward to get a DAC now, but for now my iPod holds my back. All in all these earphones are nothing short of a great catch 4.43/5.0"
108,"Using it since last 2 years .
    Ya ...the right ear iem  is no longer working .
    But it worked out a lot as my first IEM.
    Be Doubtless ,switch to IEMs & enjoy music ."
109,My first purchase from headphone zone. I was skeptical about these IEMs since I only know about the usual brands. Decided to buy these and after 1.5 years of usage this is the best IEMs I have used. The sound is very clear and we can hear all the tiny details of instruments. Bass is not that punchy but it is enough for me. Overall satisfied with the product
110,"It is only for Music lovers. The music is soft and smooth. Bass lovers don't buy this, it lacks bass whenever necessary. Apart from that, you will love its clarity. You can surely feel the difference from other earphones for sure."
111,"I had a gig on Saturday and needed six in-ears for the band - Raghav and his team at the Andheri office location hooked me up with these pieces. Great buy, saved the day for our show. Many thanks, Raghav - you run a great ship there."
112,"Great fit, the cable is high quality and great for casual listening for genres like EDM, pop and trap music"
113,My friend Recommend it if its worth please let me know
114,"This was the first product i ordered from headphone zone as a birthday present for my sibling,but i received a defective one,very dissapointed"
115,"It was my first IEM, and it was amazing."
116,It's been an Awesome experience with this IEM... Sound quality is very fine...
117,"This was my first ever IEM and dude I am blown away with these IEMs .Since i was a person who used very normal/cheap earphones(Sennheiser cx180) earlier ,These KZs were awesome for me.Looking forward to more IEMs in my forward journey"
118,One of the best IEMs in this budget.
119,The audio quality is best for a non bass head.
120,this was my first experience with chinese hi-fi and it was a very pleasant surprise. first of all the audio quality was really good. i was hearing stuff i had never heard before in songs i had been listening for years. i was worried about quality issues but these iems feel sturdy enough to last longer than i will. plus the green ones i bought look really good. and all of that for 1500. has been totally worth it.
121,First time purchase  ZST-X such a awesome IEM its looks and feels like an art work for beginners you gonna get mind blown 
122,"The best and second to none earphone I ever purchased. My first listen even without its burn in blowed up my mind.
    The comfort is great ase well.
Cons- Though I was hoping for some better quality eartips."
123,This is my first purchase in Headphone Zone. I bought it less than a week ago. Didn't have much expectations on it because of the price. But they're really great in that price range with good highs and mids. I paired it with A&K Bluetooth dac (borrowed from my uncle) with Nothing phone and it sounded great. It definitely has better detail than my galaxy buds pro. Also used it with my Sony Walkman which sounded great too. Only thing I didn't like about it is it's tips. I probably need to buy a good dac and foam tips.
124,kz zst x
125,You wont find a better sounding earphones at this price point period.
126,This was my first experience with an IEM and it's betten than I expected. Worth for this price.
127,The design is perfect it's light weight and thank you for the playlists
128,I've been daily driving them for almost 4 months now and i have to say they are the best sounding earphones I've ever used but lately the adhesive sealing from the case starts to ooze out and im fearing that one day it'll break open and i wont be able to fix it. but it doesn't seem to affect audio quality tho. im not sure if other users are facing this issue or it only happens to this particular one that i bought. that being said its still one of my favourite earphone
129,The sound quality is quite crispy and less on the bass end. Build quality is good but seems to be bulky. This earphone might be uncomfortable for use to some users. Overall a good one.
130,It fits perfectly in my ears.
131,I have been introduced to Headphone Zone by one of my Facebook homie as he recommended headphone zone for the better audio and music experience. As he suggested I've got this KZ-ZST X few months back. This is one the best ever earphone I've ever used since I started listening to music. Thanks #Headphone_Zone <3
132,It is a very good beginner's IEM. Sound quality is awesome and base is also good.
133,Buy these without a second thought if you want to get into IEMs. These sound incredible for their price!
134,"For the beginners, these are the best options for this price range."
135,"I have been using them for now over a year and a half and i have to say they have come out beautifully. The sound quality is amazing, the wrapping is amazing. The only one complaint would be that after 9 or 10 months of use it's wire started to malfunction (most probably a tear due to my bad use) but it can be also replaced for a cheaper rate. I have dropped them many times but they have been intact all the same. I have been very thankful for this one."
136,Must try
137,It's beautiful for beginners
138,"This is my First iem, it is Damn good for beginners it's fits perfectly the noise Build quality is good,cable is strong overall perfect to start with this"
139,okok
140,"So, I got these ones today. I tested it and can say these sound amazing for the price. I sound is so good that it can compete with major earphones. But sadly it's not for me. Because of the fit in ear. These earbuds sucks. After 5 minutes my ear started to hurt. After sometimes I got a headache. I've other buds types earphone  but never had any issues. But these one doesn't work for me. I tried changing provided different sizes but it doesn't seems to solve the problem. I don't know what to do. May be return it. Let's see.

... "
141,"Never expected this to be so good in terms of design, comfort and most important of all, SOUND QUALITY. Beats out any headphone I’ve used in the past, including many of major league brands like Sony, beats, etc. It’s absolutely worth the money!"
142,Literally I tried many iems in between 2K to 6K but i really love these product in these 1500 rupees segment these are the top iems in the sound quality base treble Little bit quite low but not a problem really everyone satisfies with these item really amazing you know
143,"the base is really well defined but lacks the fullerness and warmer tone in the high notes and mid vocals.
    I use AKG flat sound signature headphones and maybe I am used to those but I can always feel a major difference between the twos for the mids and highs.
    But for the price point , cant say much , Definetly worth if you are on a tight budget and like a well defined bassline instead of thumpy and overpowering base of the majority of the devices in market."
144,"For a kind of money they are asking, it a great deal.These have a ""V"" shaped sound signature and thus are good for listening to instrumentals.The Mids are lacking,but again considering the price there is nothing to complain in the Sound department.The only pain point I have with these IEM's that the flashy colours of the earpeice are not for my taste (personal opinion)"
145,If you want a budget earphones for a long term with best specs go for it!!!
146,"i didn't use iems before this.this is my first iem from headphone zone and i am really really shocked with the sound of kz zst x.these are really great,
the sound is really really loud,
the clarity of vocals is amazing,and bass
i cant cant even write down how much i am impressed,these are the best iems under the 1500.
and,
the service of headphone zone is also appreciatable.they are doing their job with honesty.
i like both,the iems and the service....."
147,"These pair of IEMs are great to get you started on the audiophile journey.
    It's definitely a value-for-money purchase and has opened up a world of sounds to listen to."
148,"It's good.
Only thing i didn't like were the eartips.Would recommend buying foam eartips along with these(if these came with it would have been great).
Watched a movie wearing these,had no discomfort.
Personally i choose these over TWS at this price.And is considering to upgrade to Bluetooth if needed in future with the Bluetooth module which is also available on this site itself...
My friend after trying these on, is also going to order one of these for himself..."
149,"I'm not a audiophile, my brother suggested me to try these. So i bought these and to my surprise the music experience I got is mind blowing😍, with these I can listen to each instrument very clearly and it feels like surrounded by whole orchestra. Now I love Ilayaraja and A.R. Rahman music 1000times more😇
Earpieces are a bit bigger so can't wear it during bed time if you sleep on one side...but for casual listening these are great choice. These earphones have mic so picking up calls is possible. Also these earpieces have removable cable so you can replace if cable damaged or cut but i bet that won't happen easily. Build quality is great.
For the price you are paying these are excellent...recommended 👍"
150,"Amazing sound stage for the price.
    The cables get tangled easy and are too long. Not ideal for carrying inside pocket and daily use."
151,Superb eraphone IEM in this range i used nearly 40 pairs of earphones from 100 to 11k including iPhone earphone but at this price range it's its equivalent to iPhone range especially when you use it in DAC or PC or high end phone you will unlock it's full potential.......it's sand that AZ09pro Bluetooth kit is not available for this model in India pls arrange it
152,One of the best and affordable iem. I loved them and also the delivery time was quick by headphone zone
153,Don't buy this product buds are good but only one mistake is getting wrong cable of this product   so different blw website cable and my delivery cable so much different im very disappointed on my first order in this website
154,"This was my first IEM ever, pretty impressed by it as a beginner. And even more impressed as a lifelong music fan.
It's pretty comfortable and easy on the ears, I tried these on every music player and tracks with varying quality. It made them all sound good.
Even further impressed by Headphonezone's customer service and range of products and their helpful youtube channel to guide you better.
An advice to anyone buying anything related to audio, give first preference to this site over any other."
155,"What a crazy headphones....... Low, mid and highs are balanced so well.....loved it so much.."
156,Just another good KZ IEM
157,"So far the reviews are very good, my friend bought one of these last week and I had to get them when I used them"
158,This is my first time buying IEMs and i gotta say im not disappointed.
159,its my first iem from headphonezone. they are great works well. you only need better dac inbuilt in your phone or portable ones to get best out of them. even they look weird they are very ergonomic. My bullets wireless cause a lot of pain after some time but kz are better in this. they are just worthy candidate in this segment. also delivery was very fast...
160,"The glue between the top part (the part on which the brand name is written) and the bottom part (the rest of the IEM) is coming off. I have to clean it up every week. I am not sure how long it's gonna last before the plastic parts separate from each other and expose the inner hardware to damage. I have never experienced such thing before. 'Chi-Fi' excellence reinforcing the China build quality 'stereotype'?
Anyways, the sound is amazing. Base doesn't overpower the other areas. Honestly impressed with everything except the glue thing."
161,The Bass quality is not good and for vocal sound it perfect but it is not for Punjabi music where we would like to enjoy the high bass and sound music. I was expecting a case where they told to less Rs 250 if will not order box and surprised to see box here refered the packing box which may cost 50 rs max.
162,Excellent
163,"I didn't have any experience with IEMs but wanted to get started on my audiophile journey.
So I jumped on a sale offer on these pair and let me tell you i wasnt disappointed.
The sound is excellent, unlike any other pair of earphones i have heard before. Every detail is crisp and its very easy to distinguish different instruments.
The bass is ever present without cutting into other frequencies thanks to dual driver design.
The build quality is something which could have been better. It feels fragile and the wire connections seem to have a lot of wiggle room.
But overall i would say an excellent product"
164,"This is the best earphone that I have used so far. I absolutely love the sound. I am no audiophile, can't comment on the technicalities of the sound but I have listened to more music on this thing in the last few days after receiving it than I have listened to this year. I absolutely love how rock music sounds on this. This is also surprisingly comfortable to wear. I wear this almost the entire day and still don't feel fatigued. I probably shouldn't do that :P.  
One weird thing about this earphone and don't know if something is wrong with my earphone or not. I have noticed glitches(audio repeating for a few seconds) while playing audio. It happens very rarely but it is there. It is rare enough that I can ignore it. I have never had this problem with any of my earphones or headphones before. I worry if this will get worse with time."
165,One of the best under 2k.
166,Zxt x is really a good wired earphone. Design is unique and comfortable for ear. Quality of output sound is awesome.
167,Zxt x is really a good wired earphone. Design is unique and comfortable for ear. Quality of output sound is awesome.
168,These earphones are good but not great.
169,These earphones are good but not great.
170,"This iem is very good for beginners audiophiles , great value for money"
171,If you‚Äôve never experienced hires audio then kz zstx are a no brainer. Although for me I find them to a little bloated and overall not a very detailed iem but for the price it sure does delivers.mids are crisp and the overall delivery is pretty fast I think it is a U shaped tuning rather than a V shaped I find the bass to be muddy. Something like a kz Zex pro or blon bl03 or a moondrop SSR are a better option but those are quite expensive when compared to these and would also require a amplification . So overall it‚Äôs the best option for a beginner. The wire quality is decent and for my ears I like the fit.
172,The sound signature is quite good. The double drivers do deliver good punchy bass. But somewhere I feed the Blons have a much more refined sound quality even with their single 10mm driver. Listening to some sound test comparisons can give a better idea what suits your taste.
173,"This was my first time buying good earphones, I've loved the experience. Now I cannot listen to anything on the generic earphone everyone has."
174,10/10 would recommend.
175,"The product was as usual delivered well before expected time line, kudos to Headphone zone for the same. About the earphone, I'm not an expert in this field but all i can say is the product has a very fun to listen sound signature, a V shaped sound signature with a pretty wide sound stage. The IEMs provides details but has I boosted (smaller amount) of treble and base for fun listening, but for me personally, love mids to listen, and its seems to be a bit uncomfortable for long listening hours as compared to my previous RHA M390U, but for the price I definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to et into serious music listening territory."
176,"I came to this after my skull candy grind wireless headphones from 2016 finally died. (well they are still alive but the ear cushions tore last year and not from a place i can stich back. the replacement ones are too expensive) 
A few cons for these IEMs you should know:
First of all, these are made for sound quality over comfort, so it just will not work (as in it would hurt) if you want to use it for calls or YouTube videos over long hours.

... "
177,"The five stars is for the team HPZ. In one of my reviews i have written that, the product I received had some issues, I was not in a mood to return or take the hassle of rising a ticket. The HPZ team connected with me and they have over taken the whole process and made it very easy for me. 
    Can't mention the persons name but thanks a bunch!.
The product is great for the value, you may find it hard to get a hybrid drive system for that price."
178,I regret if these pair sound sooooo good how much more better the sound would be if i have spent more🥺🥺.
179,Good
180,"In overall, it's perfect IEM to begin your audiophile journey!!"
181,"Comfort : Fits me perfectly 
Price to performance: it will instantly upgrade your experience. You can immediately notice more stuff happening in the songs that you have listened to countless times. You’ll notice subtle variations that you had not appreciated before. 
If you're on a tight budget, I think this is a perfect entry point. 
Durability: I’ve had mine for more than 1.5 years now I think. This one has been through a lot. I’ve dropped them a lot and so far there has not been a problem."
182,I used a lots of budget earphones but never got sound quality like this earphones.i think headphone zone is best website for buying earphones
183,"I bought the ZSN pro x initially but the fit for few female vocalists was bad. Their ear started aching. So I had to return that and purchase this. This was a weightless and perfectly fitting IEM for most of them. 
    When it comes to sound, It has the KZ spike. Very detailed. The sound stage was not that great. Sub bass is good but the midbass was lacking. Perfect for vocalists. This is the best you could get for the price."
184,Cables are not silver plated as the pictures are sowing.i got copper cables.
185,"Man was not excepting a brown coper cable, and it is not even braded very bad quality cable, does feel like HPZ is selling fake products to the costumers.
    Man i bought a lot from HPZ but this is out right bad service, I wont even bother to return cause it will take a week or so and then i have to order the IEMs again even then i am thinking these guys will send the same brown copper cable IEMs.
Really disappoint with this purchase."
186,Love it. Sounds good. Satisfactory.
187,This is my third pair of these as I was a klutz and lost the first two and the KZ ZST X is definitely an small upgrade to the previous ZSTs that I owned. Only writing this review because I have a great relationship with buying stuff from HPZ! Great stuff guys! What a quick delivery!
188,best
189,"The IEMs themselves are one of the best I have used in its price segment. There are plenty of reviews here that will go in-depth about its sound profile, but if you're searching for something that works out of the box without tinkering and don't cost a lot, these are the best in class. Also, shoutout to the team at headphonezone for making the buying and shipping process so hassle-free."
190,First impression it looked so big but soon you put in your ears its perfect fit for all sizes sound is not so awesome but better than above average. Built is also good and cable is also soft and easy to handle. Overall a good experience with HEADPHONEZONE
191,These earphones are worth buying
192,good sound
193,I also bought the kz supersoft eartips for this which elevated the comfort level to the point I didn't notice they were on. The sound quality is just perfect for me although I feel that the highs could be toned down a beat the bass quality and mids are awesome.
194,"Just what I was looking for to elevate my listening experience, and I must say it's one amazing pair of IEMs. I couldn't tell any difference when I plugged them in for the first time, because I was an absolute rookie at this sound game, and I was quite disappointed at how it wasn't all dreamy and shiny sounding. But after about an hour or two of listening and I went back to my old Skullcandy wired to see if I could tell any difference and BOY I WAS BLOWN AWAY AT HOW POOR MY SKULLCANDY REALLY SOUNDED😭. Plugged my IEMs back in AND THEN REALIZED HOW AMAZING THEY ACTUALLY SOUND. Been using them for over a year now, and honestly I can't go back to normal earphones again. If you're worried about the durability, I'm happy to announce that they quite durable, no damage or change in sound quality despite being dropped from a height of 2 metres from my table or yanking them with the wire still attached to my laptop.
The only downside being the poor eartips they come in. Just swap them out with any other silicon eartips you find from other earphones (or your old ones) like I've been using them for a year now, or you can invest in KZ's memory foam eartips which I bought a month ago. Great fit, great noise isolation, perfect.
If you're looking to begin your audiophile journey, your search ends here."
195,i going to talk about thghe main thing is very low people use this items
196,I'm very  excited
197,I would suggest many user especially beginners audiophiles to start your experience this  piece of earphones qs it has a perfect V shaped sound signature.The treble heard is amazing and no other marketed earphones can produce thses type of sound.
198,One of my best purchase of 2021
199,"Loved these! they get quite loud, and the mic provided is pretty good as well"
200,"I just recently discovered headphonezone and I regret not having got my older earbuds from here, 
    I got these ZST Xs from amazon a few months ago.
Build and comfort are great on these and the purple ones I got just look stunning. 
Coming to sound, 
    These focus on the bass a bit too much for my taste and hence why I stopped using them after a while and started using the moondrops quarks and CCA CA4s more."
201,"These sound great. I definitely heard all the notes that i was missing out with my previous headphones.
 It's made of plastic, they look great, feels sturdy and very light, they don't even feel like they're there. 
These are my first iems and they didn't disappoint and because of it i don't have anything thing to compare it to other than cheap ones or my Sennheiser bullets which are good but this is better. 
The box was small but had everything necessary the buds are good. The instructions to plug in the cables were simple. The song recommendations from headphonezone were great, good packaging too. The delivery was fast and got constant updates. 
The wires look good and no problem with rubbing on my shirt like my Sennheisers. 
The singular button on the mic was surprising too, i thought they were just for answering calls but double tap skips tracks and holding down brings up google assistant. The ear hooks are too big for my ears but that's ok they keep the iems in fine. I bought these because of the video on headphone zone's yt channel, it was a great decision and videos are great too."
202,GREAT PRODUCT DONT OWN IT PERSONALLY BUT HAVE USED IT !
203,Have Been Using It For A While Worth The Price .
204,this is nice earphone under 1500.
205,the zst x are amazing iem s would prefer zsn pro x but these are good for its price
206,Good earphones with very good sound quality
207,I am crying. Out of hapiness.
208,Its very good
209,The packing is good and we get a detachable cable which seems to be silver coated. The bass is on the upper edge while the vocals seems to be somewhat down and lacks clarity. The build quality is good with tough plastic and comes in two color options. The price could have been somewhat less as the with mic option is too high. An additional black color option is suggested too
210,Good product
211,My first IEM from Headphonezone…Absolutely loved the Detailed Sound…Definitely not going back to regular earphones…Looking forward to buying more IEMs very soon!
212,"Awesome piece of Tech, as a beginner a good start with it, everything to me works great, the frequency, lows, mids, tember, highs is really great. Loved it!!!"
213,"First time I hear on kz my eyes open for a sec , I can hear a ton of things it's a beautiful moment for me . Thanks hz , definitely one day I will upgrade my earphone"
214,"Writing review when I'm out right now so not too good pic. So these earphone are gorgeous and available at a reasonable price and gives a great performance. The reason I use 'clean' word is because when even you are listening to  something a little louder you still can get the same audio and bass quality which you get at normal range while most of the earphone available might not give the same quality when listening to something a little louder and the audio might even start to crack.
Conclusion:YOU CAN FEEL AUDIO AND BASS TOTALLY DIFFERENT."
215,"The best pair of earphones I've ever used, the bass is tight and punchy, mids and highs are good, build quality is pretty neat according to the price.
    Sadly I have to buy external dac for them to sound great🥲"
216,It's my first IEM and I loved it!
217,"The product is bit fragile but the looks and comfort are great but need a memory foam ear tips for the best fit and for long time usage. The sound is just as given in the description which is great, it feels a bit shrilling some times 
     The cables are looking great and of good quality"
218,"Am not an audiophile but an ardent enthusiast intriguinged by possibilities of acoustics technology. This was my first meaningful spend on a good earphone and i would say it was worth it. I have been using some good earphones overtime and have been in constant search to better my previous purchase and this one was spot on. The clarity it brings to the music is phenomenal and nothing seems to be overpowering. Would have liked bit more thump to the bass but its definitely not underpowered. Unlike current midrange Chinese market players which have created a lot of bass heads craving for senseless bass, this will create a new species of music lovers craving for more clarity. With my existing earphones i used to hear specific songs in loop for hours just because i liked it that way (or probably searching for something), however the same song's on these headphones never created such cravings possibly because my quest for detailing got fulfilled the first time. Now i am inclined to try higher versions of these or even other brands but i also fear that i should not go to that mode just because i will not be able afford it 😭 and soon i would be bankrupt then😜. Build quality and fitments were good will like to try the compatible bluetooth accessories. The wire seems sturdy but not tangle free due to its texture."
219,"So I am not an Audiophile but I suppose I have become one considering what Raghav sir said about the criteria to be an Audiophile.
Jokes apart😁.
Coming to the earphones. At the very first use it didn't met my expectations. I became quite skeptical. But it's common sense due to the excitement of putting those in my ear what I lacked was patience and attention. I am writing this review on the second day, after listening quite a few songs from every genre in Spotify premium. Believe me it does whatever you expect from it, more precisely great bass the punch in it, the sound of different instruments playing in the background are absolutely clear.
Comfort wise great, sound isolation great. Thankyou headphonezone for your amazing service, super fast delivery, and for this amazing sounding earphone.
Great job.
Lots of love"
220,"Arrived today morning , my first iems.Build and Cable good and also stylish.Vocals and treble are great for price.Bass is their but not bass heads.I like clarity more than bass so I decided to go for these iems.soundstage is wide, volume level is very high for earphones I heard before.
    Iam fully satisfied with this purchase."
221,This is good enough for the price point. Well balanced sound and has a good feel to it. Would recommend to anyone who's tight on budget but wants the best bang for their buck
222,Nice
223,"Thanks to HZ for the quick delivery (as always) in this tough situation!
Initially I was little hesitate to order this as it chines and not much idea about KZ. 
    But it sounds excellent. Multiple drivers make the sound stage and clarity.
    Clean Mids, Highs are little brighter with enough highs."
224,Very glossy and very clear sound producing
225,They are decent enough for playing pubg and hearing but at highter volumer they distort especially on mine right side one. Would recommmend as its available in cheaper price 1400 only
226,After using it for months I can easily say that its the best in the budget! First of all im surprised how good they sound at this price range and since i purchased it from HZone I was assured to get the original sealed product.
227,Great earphone for old school audiophiles...might not love edm on it but hands the best under 2k or 3k for rock and punk
228,"Super Awesome , one of the bestest earphone I ever had. Super punchy bass with crystal clear sound. I highly recommend for all music freak individual. Value for money."
229,"Beautiful, one word"
230,These iems sound excellent but there eartips aren't at all comfortable
231,"Literally my favorite Earphones ever....
    I saw the review on headphone zone's channel and they described it as it sounds...
    best IEM's under 2000.
    the treble is really nice and bass is quite descent."
232,"Not for bass lovers
    Ideal for pop, rock , classic , reggae , jazz"
233,best earphone under 1500.
234,"An excellent product for a beginner audiophile. Rests easy in the ears, the fit is pretty much perfect and can stay in there all day long without causing any discomfort. The music is pure joy. At this price range the KZ ZST X is a steal."
235,Fantastic product
236,"Amazing IEMs, they fit well, the colours are nice and most of all, they sound great for the budget!"
237,Very Noice
238,First of all I just fell in love with color scheme of this IEM and it sounds spectacular.
239,This model works excellent from Feb but now I'm facing mic issue on raising claim in CHI-FI it's not showing KZ brand how to fix it
240,Its smaller in size as shown but it's way more powerful
241,"My first try at IEMs and gotta say, pretty impressed."
242,Nice Sound and Nice Product. Good comfort to your ear
243,Good product bassy sound signature
244,"Sound wise one of the best 
    Comfort could be a little better 
    Gonna buy it for second time."
245,The sound quality are really good for Music and also somewhat good for gaming. It's really comfortable for long gaming sessions. It could provide clip for adjusting the Mic as it is low u will have speak a little bit louder while communicating.
246,"This is the second pair of KZ IEMs I purchased in a week's time. Impressed with the ZST, I gave it to my wife, I got myself the X factor. You can clearly understand the difference in the sound profiles between the ZST and ZSTX. ZST gives you a lower end thump whereas the ZSTX is more refined. So someone who is looking for bass at an affordable price, go for the ZST and if looking out for refined mellow audio profile with high range frequency, go for the ZSTX. I am now hooked to IEMs."
247,"i always used apple earpods and thought they were good until a friend of mine introduced me to ur website... The price tag u guys are working with is unbelievable.. i never knew i could afford to hear music like this at such a low cost ... as good as the product is ,im more in love with the way u guys handle ur customers and the service u provide .
    -ur newest fanboy"
248,"THIS was my first IEMS and you believe or not they are just boom 💥.awesome...THE CLARITY,SOUND DROPS,NOISE CANCELLATION THEY PROVIDE ARE JUST OUT OF THE WORLD..IF THIS BUDGET IEMS CAN MAKE this much hype then think about the high rated IEMS.DONT THINK JUST GO FOR IT.❣️"
249,"Sound Quality was so good, the details in the music is terrific. I used Sony earphones(xb55ap) earlier but this IEM trumps every other one i have used so far."
250,Impressive audio quality
251,"Good shipping experience.
    IEMs are light weight. 
    The ear buds keep falling off.
    Felt pain in my ears after using it for 2 hrs straight, due to overall deign. 
    To the touch build is decent, does not feel premium.
    Volume is loud enough.
    Sound frequencies at 7k to 10k is hot, yes its high for stage. but overall spectrum is ok."
252,"i have only one issue and its that i got the wrong color delivered to me.
Other than that i am super satisfied with my purchase."
253,best color
254,beautiiful sound
255,"Hats off to the team, for the blazing fast processing and shipping, ordered them on Saturday night and got them on Tuesday, only Monday went into processing and shipping, as Sunday is a day off. First things first, i burnt them in for a good 7 hours straight out of the packet for a whole night, and they sound just amazing, the bass is not the primary concern of these earphones, so i wont prefer them for someone seeking punchy and thumping bass outta these babies, although having a V signature they don't have that excessive bleeding bass, the mids and the high are just fantastic, if you've never had an experience with a quality headset before, you are definitely going to get amazed. Try using them to play some hi res audio. Only problem is that the ear-tips are a nightmare, they just don't fit properly, and cause pain as the large tip is extremely snug while the medium and small are way too loose, i realised this after using it for a whole day on Wednesday as they caused tremendous pain in the ear canal and the temporals, it’s only after replacing the tips with my used earphone’s ones, that i am using these new ones now."
256,Sound is amazing 😍 good product
257,i liked the overall sound signature of this device. and i am not a great audiophile.but the overall experience is much better than other earphones i used.the bass is great. its very comfort in ear even though eartips could havebeen more better
258,"They sound amazing.
    Only downside is the bass is a little on the lower side"
259,"I am a budding audiophile who is still testing the waters and trying to find out what sort of headphones I really like and whether I really am an audiophile or not. But boy did I love the sound the KZ zst x has treated me to in the last few weeks.
Thanks to this I realise now, that I love a bit of sound stage and this has got plenty of it which is so surprising given the price. The lows are not punchy but just about right and mids are very very detailed and crisp. But I do feel these are a little bright for my taste (especially at higher volumes) but that can be easily fixed with a bit of EQ work. 
I currently own a pair of audio technica m50x , a Bose qc35ii and Jabra active 75t. But after listening to the kz's I have to say, the detail retrieval may not be as good as the m50x but it's very similar. Ofcourse the bass is no where as amped up as the jabras but we get a very fun dynamic bass which does not feel overpowering at all but at the same time does feel enjoyao. Even the vocals in the mid range are capable of competing with the qc35ii (which arguably is the strong suit of the qc series). So in short I am definitely not saying that this is some all encompassing all-in-one product but it's punching in the leagues which are way above it's weight and its holding its ground. The only place where i see room for improvement (not that something which cost me 1300 bucks should have to justify anything😂) is in the highs. The treble is sort of overpowering and could do with some EQ work to dial down( 8k to 10k range) a bit.(just a personal preference)
The one aspect though which I feel I have to share is that these are probably not the most comfortable pairs to listen to long sessions of music even though they fit seamlessly in my ear canals.(I've tried a max of 3 hours). I felt very fatigued with it and don't feel I can listen to extended periods beyond the 2-3 hour mark. but maybe that's just my personal preference (I do realise I prefer the over ear design above the in ear design in terms of comfort during extended listening during travelling or during office etc) so anyone reading feel free to explore because I feel, just like it is with sound, comfort is extremely subjective too. To each his own I guess.
I'm excited to explore more of this world and I'm happy to say that I'm off to a crazy start.😊"
260,Treble is super. Base is not as expected but not bad.. it's super
261,soud quality unmatched for a product of this price.
262,design is superbly done....sound quality is of another level.
263,"You guys are doing really a great job, in past i was literally crying to have IEMs like these which i got from you because of some stupid silly brands like boat, KZ ZST-X these IEMs are really great in 1600rs bass, vocal and all other things is really out standing🤩.
    (I wish to work with you guys)"
264,I have bought this earphone for online classes and It's simply amazing
265,"I loved my earphones in the very few hoursI started using it. Audio quality is really good. Having used a wide variety of audio gear, i find this one astonishingly professional for a fraction of the price of the big guys. The only 2 issue I found was : 
    1) the cable coms off easily from the earpiece
    2) the fit in my left ear is not comfortable. after about 2 hours or so, it starts hurting me. no issue with the right earpiece though. I am not sure if its my ear's problem."
266,Thanks to Headphone zone for there honest review and timely delivery.The earphones are made of plastic shells which look sturdy and can resist your usual wear and tear. The cable is also of the decent quality. But none of the things are the selling point of these headphones. KZ promises audio quality and delivers it!
267,Thanks to Headphone zone for there honest review and timely delivery.The earphones are made of plastic shells which look sturdy and can resist your usual wear and tear. The cable is also of the decent quality. But none of the things are the selling point of these headphones. KZ promises audio quality and delivers it!
268,"I'm very impressed with the price point given that it has a wide sound stage, feels like a V-Shaped signature. It's got a thumping bass, which I'm not a big fan of. More importantly, the dual drivers make the magic happen - I could almost hear every instrument distinctively. Sturdy build! Although, it takes some time to get used to the fit. Great pick! Thanks, Headphone Zone!"
269,"Really impressed with this earphone, my first purchase from headphone zone."
270,value for money
271,"Got my order delivered in 2 days so first of all props for that. Coming to the earphones they look amazing with the transperent casing. Haven't had any issues with the fit. The build quality of the earphones themselves is really good will have to see if the zst x comes off but they feel solid in your hand. The cable feels a little less solid but then again it's a noise free cable unlike most other normal earbuds.
I'm not an audiophile but I can tell this that the bass is just good and tight and doesn't overpower or hinder other frequencies. The volume goes really high as well. And for the price you just cannot go wrong. I don't want to give 5 stars because nothing can be perfect but for less than 2k I have no choice."
272,Overall product is good as hell but i have some problem to fit the cable to earphone
273,Nice IEM at this price
274,"Just one word. Heavenly !!!!
    Fits in  comfortably ( my ear size is small). The sound generated is inside your head"
275,"I have only one word, amazing!
The best iem under 2k. All the frequencies are well-calibrated. Doesn't feel over the top. I bit of boosted bass, but other than that an amazing package at an affordable price. You can surely go for it. You won't regret it.
Cheers!"
276,Best bang for buck
277,"I had neither used a pair of iems nor heard of them before,infact I was going to buy the sony xb55ap as my sister has the same pair of sonys and I liked the sound and build quality.But fortunately they were out of stock and so I was just surfing the website and found these were recommended heavily and so I bought these KZs.
    The sound quality is phenomenal,I had never heard anything like this on pair of earbud that cost so low,it beats the xb55ap in sound quality for sure."
278,"So it's been great over all.
Recent Bollywood songs sound GREAT. was able to hear new nuances and instruments.
Pop like Drake, weekend sound slightly better than other normal in your ears or wireless earphones.
Fusion Jazz sounds amazing on these. Sound seperation and stage is good. 
Check out BadBadnotGood's or Snarky Puppy's songs on these. 
Classical - Big Fail (ofcourse not bad, but I'm being harsh on them as they set the bar higher with earlier genres)
Blues - Okayish. Basic old john Mayer songs and eric Clapton. Haven't used a DAC/Amp like ibasso dc03 yet.
I use a one plus 7 T. You ideally need an amp/dac with these for this phone.
They work amazing on my windows laptop without any amp etc.
I have used youtube music to listen all those genres.
It's weirdly great with all Bollywood numbers, while it fell flat in comparison when I played classic rock/pop like eagles.(Disco dancer/new kid in town) 
It shown like a jewel when I played Time by pink Floyd but again was a slight let down for john petrucci's Damage Control.
Maybe its better with the ibasso set up. Still need to experience that.
All in all, it's amazing for certain genres buts lacks in classical and pure metal as we don't have strong basslines to add the wholesome flavours.
Definitely a good buy for the price. Would recommend it. These were my first IEMs.  until you don't get it, you won't understand that type of EIMs you would want to invest in next on your journey to be an audiophile.
They are hands down better than any TWS headsets out there all said and done."
279,"Being new to the IEM world, I was reading reviews in different forums on IEMs and ChiFi audio for a while. Was doing a research on IEMs ranging from 2k -30k, but couldn't decide which one to buy. Recently watched a video review of Raghav from Headphone Zone about ZST X and immediately ordered this. The moment I hooked it to an iPhone and listened to a violin piece from L. Subramanian. It gave me a completely new music listening experience, which I haven't had with Beyerdynmaic DT 770 or Sony-WH-MX1000M4. Continued with ""Black Cow"" of Steely Dan, ""Looking for Someone"" from Genesis, ""Cryin' Blues"" by Charles Mingus, ""Late Night"" by Foals, Arabian Dance (Coffee) by Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Ilayaraja's Thiruvasakam in Symphony for the next 4 hours. All sounded lifelike and out of this world. Amazing soundstage, excellent sound signature and it sounds life like from the first song and you don't have to wait for burn-in. For 1590/-, without even using a DAC or AMP or Hi-Res player, it sounds audiophile grade and recently no other product has given me that wow factor and complete satisfaction like KZ-ZST X. A great product at an astonishing price."
280,"Combination of Raw musiq, cool mids and lows, sufficient bass in affordable price. Its actually better than headphones priced over 3k. Recommended for beginner Audiophiles"
281,This is arguably the best IEM in this range and a fair improvement over the original ZST. The sound signature is balanced and tuned quite well. Audiophiles looking for a more pronounced bass should opt for the slightly more expensive ZSN Pro X model with its V-shaped sound sig. The cable provided is decently sturdy but I'd still recommend getting a backup pair of cables. One thing which the pictures do not indicate well is how comfortable it is and how well it fits and the shape adds to the comfort. I would definitely recommend getting this one before it goes out of stock.
282,Just one word - AWESOME !
283,"Compared to what i have used before it isn't even close to satisfactory mark leave alone the fact that it doesn't have  stand out features or any wow factor. 
The voice is clear but only limited to some tracks, many a times the sound of the instruments gets washed away under the vocals and bass is like there but only when you tweak up the equaliser.
I didn't even find them comfortable for long term use like RHA are , hurts the lower part of my ear's and yeah the calls via these ones are very bad like it so annoying for the ears maybe it's my phone but it didn't happen in my previous RHA model so most probably it's the problem of this one.
Therefore not a good purchase for me but can be good for people who are buying there 1st set of good iem but not for me."
284,"can't explain how amazing these things are..sound quality is ""out of this world"""
285,"Extremely lightweight, super comfortable, premium looking earphones with pop colors what else you need! Ohh sound quality that’s mind blowing."
286,Awesome earphones... One word... flagship killer
287,"Best pair of earphones ever had, worth every penny"
288,Nothing's above it.
289,KZ - ZST X
290,Well I have used it for the last 3-4 days after burning it and I am feeling satisfied about my purchase. The earphones fit good in my ears blocking a lot of outside noise. Good Product
291,KZ - ZST X
292,These are lit🔥
293,"KZ ZST X best ear phone at his price..!! It is not for bass lover. But sure if want experience music and dont want to miss any beat. This is the budget earphone with excellent Quality.
    After Audio Technica Cor150 and M50x. This is also favourite and recommended earphone I love this earphone..!!"

297,KZ - ZST X
298,"good quality,good sound"
299,"Extremely pretty to look at and a welcome change from my black earphones/headphones that I always buy.
The sound signature is kind of bright, not really for bass lovers but I like my sound signature to be flat- reproducing sound as it is.
The sound clarity is good.
I have gotten compliments on it's looks.
The over-ear design-it's got a curve to fit your ear- can take a litle getting used to; I yanked the cord a couple of times! But the design is comfortable and dope!
But-they are Chinese and they are delicate! So be careful and I reckon they should be good!"
300,"Had already used these earphones before so the performance wasn't a big surprise.  Have bought my fair share of entry level 'audiophile' earphones but this pair of in-ears give the best value for your money at this price range. Comfort was excellent. Audio quality is also excellent to my untrained ears. Getting the right buds to get a good seal will bring out the lows though the included Large buds will suffice for me. I could actually hear better instrument separation in these compared to the AKG in-ears that came bundled with  Samsung phones. The mic quality is very usable. The cable should last long enough. All in all,  happy with the purchase.
Also,  the delivery speed (within 24 hrs) was very impressive especially taking the pandemic into account. 
Keep up the good work, Headphonezone!"
301,"First IEMs and since I'm not an audiophile, rather only a lay listener, I'm not sure how good these earphones are. They are balanced, but I don't know if it is fair to compare them to the sony wh-1000x M3 headphones, which sounded fuller or in-depth, when I played Dijf Sanders' Hanuman (a Belgian electronic artist's Balinese masterpiece) or Jen Erikkson's intense Forest Trance. The earphones were definitely much louder but the intricacies were missing. 
With that said, these are my upgrade on the Sennheiser CX275s and I think the KZ sound better in that comparison. 
Again, I cannot make a comparisons wrt technicalities and specifications. But so far so good."
302,KZ - ZST X
303,Awesome
304,Good IEM for the price.
305,"I have used variety of good earphones, but under this price these are far better then any of those with almost double the price. Sound clarity, bass and crisp are very enjoyable."

309,Received delivery very fast and the ear phones are very good.
310,"# The delivery and packaging was top notch. Kudos to the team @headphonezone.
# The KZ - ZXT X are really comfortable in my ears, but the tips are not that great
# Best sounding IEMs for the price range, quality is really amazing!
#"
311,It's awesome
312,Extremely extremely happy...💖
313,"One of the best sounding earphones in this price range with large soundstage and good highs and mids, but the lower end is not that prominent. I didn't have any issues with fitting and they feel very comfortable in the ear."
314,Everything is amazing about this earphone the design comfort & sound quality...I just love it & a bigggggg thank you to you guys for delivering it so quick  👏🤗
315,"This is a work of art. My first IEM, will move on to purchase a DAC+AMP to complete the magic. Blown away by the clarity, I could identify every instrument piece, and drum sections to perfection. Balance in truest sense. Thanks a ton Headphone Zone!!"
316,"Very good product.. 
    I love the sound... 
    I never experienced like this... Fantastic sounds effect..."
317,KZ - ZST X
318,"Its been over 25 years since I started to listen to music over walkman. However, till I began my Audiophile journey with this IEM, I never knew what I missed. This is great headset for the price and I would not be surprised if it was to be sold 2-3 times price higher."
319,I m not an audiophile nor an expert..but this earphone is different..Way better than Soundmagic e10 c ..Its amazing..but the headphone built is fragile so cant be rough handled..Its worth to buy..Thanks headphone zone for such a fast delivery..March 2nd late evening i ordered..today morning i got the product..kudos..This is my 2nd buy frm u guys n many more will come in the future as well...
320,"Bought this for a friend, she's definitely having a great time with these, the soundstage according to her is excellent, she's never settling for other more popular brands after owning these."
321,Overall good product
322,KZ - ZST X
323,"Well after a lot of thoughts, research and calculations I zeroed in on 2 options KBear ks2 and KZ ZST X i decided on kz zst only bcs of budget constraints but i was surprised by super quick delivery of Headphonezone guys so full marks! Packing was excellent and I start my hifi journey. Btw l own only a 1more piston fit so far and l am very impressed with their performance, handling for the price so far. I would recommend them anytime for daily use without burning your pockets. So for starting, the kzs are a bit heavier than piston but thats just my first impression.I will shortly post the feedback of performance soon, maybe in few days."
324,Not the best but worth every penny
325,fine for stage i.e. monitoirs

329,"I've been using realme buds 2 and decided to get a pair of iems... After speaking to a friend, I got kz zst x and oh boy, they sound amazing the bass is thumpy, vocals r pretty clean and nice, treble is slightly high.. sounds bright.. rest all it's pretty good and I'm pretty satisfied with my kz zst x... Noise isolation is kinda okay not that impressed but everything else is amazing.."
330,"Im really surprised by their sound, they sounds amazing, i have a plenty of earphones, not the cheapest but Also under the budgets, I had jbls, Samsung, blaupunkt, evidson, realme, Huawei, honor etc,. I have wired in ears, over ears and wireless neckbands, tws, airpod alternatives. It's my first iem experience thnx to kz, and also a big thanx to headphonezone"

333,KZ - ZST X
334,I didn't really found much difference between kz and boat rockerz 400. they are wireless and 500 lesser in price
335,"I've used many earphones of different ranges from different companies.I'm new to the IEM and through the research I found out, KZ-ZST X is the best intro IEM out there.I would say that this one do the justice completly.I found out from the very first song,that song has these much detailed sound ""hidden"".So after the burning period of around 200hours I'm writing this review with pros and cons:
Pros:
1.I'll start with the comfort zone,it doesn't cause any irritation or fatigue even after 8hrs of complete listening.
2.The highs and mid are out of the mind and super sharp as well.
3.It's super light weight,I have to make sure after sometime that its still on the ear (LOL).
4.You will never get a good IEM from this range.Yay!
5.I guarantee you that,you'll get blown away when you hear from this for the first time.My eyes literally dropped down(LOL)
**Kudos to the Headphone Zone for the super fast delivery.
Cons:
1.I must say that,those who are BASS heads,might not really like this one.It doesn't mean that thers is no bass!It has but not at that extreme.I said this bcz there are some ppl who prefer Bass more.
2.I DIDN'T LIKE THE CABLE WHATSOEVER!!!!
3.It's made of complete plastic,so if you're a person who has a hole in your hand,means if you have a habit of accidental dropping earphones,I would say that this one doesn't last too long.
4.Yes,the mic quality is not that good."
336,"Low end is really good ,does bleed into the mids a lil bit but still really good. highs are subjuctive. i came from using a sennheiser and i am very much used to it's sound signature, the crystal clear mids and an avarage low end, but i cant find that sparkling trouble in this. I would say it has a good highs not awesome and the instrumental separation is good. Tonality is on the avarage, male vocals doesn't have that puch. The build quality is really good even though it's entirely plastic build its going to last you a long time. Comfort wise u will get used to it within a week or so. It pains a lil bit,at least for my ears ( my ear size is avarage, medium sized).  I'm using it with power amp music player their equrisers are really good . Overall i would say I'm happy with my purchase.
It's really nice if u could change ur delivery service from delhivery. Delivery could have been better."
337,"As a music addictor, this is one more in my collection. ❣️
It fits perfectly in my ears.
Sound feels far more better than the other earphones under 2000/- 
Just go for it. 
It feels comfortable in long run also. 
Bass is on the point. 
Treble could have been a little better.
Mids feels good. 
Overall, it's perfect for exercise session and gaming too!"
338,"Has a Punchy Bass, mids are Good, Highs are a bit harsh for me in some tracks (it's only with EDM but for Vocals, Rock, Pop, Jazz etc. They are perfect). I would say one of the best under 2k price bracket.
    Bass: 9
    Mids: 8
    Highs: 8.5
    Fit : 8.5
    Comfort :8
    Build: 8

... "
339,"After using it form 1 year 7 months my view on KZ ZSTx
    Pros: 1.Very clear seperation of instruments (4.6/5)
              2.Great vocals and mids (3.8/5)
              3.Professional Bass (4/5) Note: I am not a bass head
     Cons:1. Lows are poor 
               2. Cannot Upgrade to Bluetooth Modules because of pins.
               3. Only Fits for C-pin Upgraded cable"
340,KZ - ZST X
341,Nice earphones better than sony only thing is this cable and i want to know can we get bluethoot modules seperately for this type of earphones
342,"I was looking for a small earphone that I can carry anywhere and also something that sounds great. I was not exactly looking for an IEM, just a regular pair of earphones with a clean sound signature. I decided to buy this after seeing a few YouTube reviews as well as after reading a few reviews from this website. I was shocked as to how good they sound for the price. There is nothing more i can say  about these iem's, a lot of them have already explained in detail as to how amazing they are. All I'll say is if you are looking for an iem or a pair of great sounding earphones under 2k give this one a shot you won't be disappointed. They sound so much better than costlier earphones/headphones. Go for it! Am glad i did."
343,"My background: I am using open back sennhieser hd598sr headphones as my primary device for last 2 years.
Fitting: they don't fall off. They can hurt after using for 2+ hours but if you just remove them for 5 mins or so then your ears will go back to normal.
Sound: I feel soundstage is very cramped (but I am biased because of using open back headphones for so long). Using eq will definitely affect your audio. 
Cable: too long but that isn't a bad thing
Overall: they are good for price range"
344,"It sounds really amazing and the fit is so comforting. The bass is good and loud for which i thought it would supress the treble clarity but i was wrong. Both the bass and treble are clear. 
    The major drawback is the material quality."

346,"I have used the ma390, Byron's, e10c's and plethora of other earphones under 2000 rupees and none of them had a soundstage as good as this one. You could literally hear every little detail coming out of different directions and it will appeal to you in every way if you are into psy music or deephouse music or basically any genre of music that requires a three dimensional soundstage. I've also noticed that the rha ma390 and the e10c has a better sound quality compared to these ""only"" if you are using a device that has a hifi dac, if you compare all three of them through a basic smartphone then kz's will beat every other earphone at this price segment. The rha's shine only when you use them through a laptop,an iPad or a hifi dac. I don't think everyone is an audiophile and not everyone carries a hifi audio device for their casual listening with them, but everyone would listen to their favourite genres through a smartphone and if you are someone who just uses a smartphone as a primary source for your audio then do not even look for other earphones in this price range, I sometimes think how can a 1800rs iem sound so good. It's a masterpiece."
347,"I was searching for replacement for my bose wired earphones as they were discontinued, bought rha ma390 and was disappointed in them and then I bought these and suprisingly these are better than my bose soundsport wired in every way. Perfect and really awesome. Just buy these and you will not be disappointed if you are not a hardcore audiophile."

349,"The audio quality is excellent way better than what earphones offer at this price point. They even managed to deliver the product the next day after dispatch at my request since it was a birthday present, that too at a very short notice. I'm extremely pleased with the customer service.
    And about the product its way better than the conventional earphone. And if ur buying this product after having used earphones then please go for it...ur in for a surprise!!"
350,I am overly impressed by the sound profile and bass quality. The wiring and removable earpods just blew me away already...
351,Wasnt expecting this quality for something priced so low. All I can say that the review was so right.
352,"I got this pair after being recommended by a bunch of peers, the sound quality is undoubtedly phenomenal but they do get slightly uncomfortable for longer periods of listening. It's probably just my ears, but yeah. Planning on changing the eartips, hope it helps :3"

    Same headphones aviable unbox in cheapest price..
    So I feel bad..
    Overall review is good .
    After few days I will post nice photos with tag..
Thanks for good service .."
356,"Since the KZ-ZST X was bought very recently, it has not been burnt-in properly as yet. Therefore, I cannot venture to ""review"" it. At the most, I can just record my first impression, which is very positive. The audio experience is rich and rewarding. As I put in more hours (and different genres of music), I can feel the IEM getting better. All in all, I can claim to be a satisfied customer. Thanks are due to Delwyn for recommending these earphones (the name ""KZ Acoustics"" was unheard of prior to that) to me."
357,"First time owned IEMs and pleasing sound. Right on budget and quality, and became my daily driver.
I am not an expert but sound is pleasing, and I don't feel  discomfort evern after listening long (couple of hours) which was not the case when using Sony WH1000xm3. 
It can be good and recommended start in IEM world."
358,"My expectations were not very high despite all the reviews and youtube videos. But after listening to them, they do sound really good for the price. The mids are crisp and bright and ideal for me. Since I edit youtube videos and podcast these are just the right thing for the job without breaking the bank. The build quality is a little delicate, that means you do have to take care of these."
359,"Sound quality is above average for the price. But, the starlined eartips are frankly a letdown. They don't quite form a perfect seal, and start feeling uncomfortable after awhile. Issues like these aren't expected from heaphones which would be worn for a long time for listening to music. If you place audio quality higher than general comfort, go for it.
Even though the build is completely plastic, it doesn't matter as it makes them light."

362,"The title is pretty self explanatory, but expanding on that, I read a few reviews before getting this pair, and while most of them praised the sound quality, I was very of it being a run off the mill Chinese earphones, but I really liked the colour and went ahead. Packing is amazing, very premium looking, cable looks a little flimsy but I don't mind much since it's replaceable. It has a very snug fit and feels very comfortable, and good noise isolation as well. Sound quality is not awesome but amazing considering it's price. Definitely better sound quality compared to its similar priced competitors, but what really surprised me was that the control button was not working out of the box. And adding to the disappointment was that the microphone was not working either. The other person just gets a blank sound output while on call. Tested it with both Android and iOS to be sure. Placed a replacement request with hpz, but I can't help saying I'm disappointed it didn't work at all."
363,I have returned my order due to deliver issues and soon i will reorder them on my new address
364,"its good ..... i am using it on sage. low end is fine but high end is higher  than expected . otherwise its very good affordable. 
    also I want to mention that I am very happy with your service."
365,"First of all I really want to thank @Headphonezone to make me understand the difference between earphones and iem's. Also, their wide range of superb collection to choose the best and suitable to one is pretty much easy work.
Now coming to the point, these are the best in class, under budget and ubercool pair of iem's. Build quality is very good. Cable is just awesome and yes it does not get tangled easily. The Bass is ok, as I like. Trebles are on point, high's and low's are good, mid's are superb. Overall a no-brainer choice if one wants to start their audiophile journey.
For sure, I am not going back to earphones. In future also I will only choose and buy iem's and that too only from this trusted place, one and only @Headphonezone. Thanks team, great work and keep it up."
366,Iam not received the product yet
367,Good
368,"After stalking your website for months, I finally made my first purchase.
First I would like to say thanks, thanks headphone zone.
Coming to this product, at first, I didn't like these maybe because of the ear tips, tips doesn't fit well, wasn't able to carry well, that's my first impression n it wasn't good at all.
Later I get used to my old tips and I start loving these.
If your budget is around 2k, then you can blindly go for this, (for me tips provided by them doesn't fit well, it might fit you! that's the only con.
If that sets you truly gonna love these.
Just a feedback
Please mention that it won't deliver with a carry case,
Someone in a review posted pic with a carry case, it might mislead people, even I thought I will get a case with this.
That's it,
Thanks once again."
369,"After listening on these i was blown away. I didn't knew such a small device can deliver such a great audio. Just don't expect much bass from it, bass is good but not that great."
370,"I have listened to this pair for about 30 hrs so far, having bought it on impulse, exclusively based on the top 10 headphones recommended by the headphone zone.
1- The difference in sound quality is very evident. Compared with sennheiser 275s, Audio technica Ath-100, and in some ways better than Bose qc35II.
2- I was able to discern instruments and sounds that I was unable to with the other earphones. Better instrument separation that I believe is the USP of IEMs.
3- Sound stage is also wider- in a quiet listening ambience when listening intently, I was able to place the instruments and vocals across a wider area and depth
4- The IEMs and the cable themselves are built well, but the connectors look like cheap plastic. I’m glad the cable can be separated and upgraded easily later on.
5- The inline mic sounds good enough for occasional calls, but I’d rather use these for music
6- Sound signature is balanced, no excessive bass that spills over. Vocals and mids are clear even at high volume"
371,"This is my first ever shopping experience on headphonezone, and it's been good. The IEMs are great as everyone else have already said in so many reviews. They're close to perfect with only one thing that's a little annoying and it's the quality of the eartips provided. I would have fallen in love with kz zst x the moment i put them on, if the eartips were a little better than they are."
372,Very enjoy to listen songs
373,"So I recently purchased the KZ ZSTX and while I'm impressed by the sound quality as well as the playful colors & build quality, the earphones have been extremely difficult to use for me owing to the fitting of the ear tips. 5 min into listening and the eartips start slipping off. Sadly it's because I haven't been able to get the best fit. Apart from this the overall sound quality is great, with impressive soundstage and imaging at this price point. Love the instrument separation. But I am just unsure of how much I'll be able to enjoy these to the fullest as the ear tips are not comfortable for me & don't fit me properly. Sad, as this was my first IEM purchase ever.
Anyway, the earphones look great, with neon-ish colours. Sound is pretty well balanced, although sometimes the highs can be slightly harsh, especially in rock/metal. Bass is how I wanted it - balanced and yet it flows nicely into the mids without overpowering them. All in all, a great earphone, except that for me the fit is just not correct."
374,Nice

376,The design looks cool. The comfort is amazing too. and the sound quality is balanced
377,"Sound - the bass is just enough, the vocals are bright, and treble is enough to complement the bass and mids. Balanced signature, aptly described on the website. One thing that I found so beautiful in its sound was the sound stage. The IEM based design just amplifies the sound stage experience and noise cancellation is also awesome. Due to this, loudness is even enough at 60% output. I found them better than sony XB55Ap and RHA 390. 
Looks - amazing, urban, metrosexual. I bought the purple one. 
Fitting - they justify being IEMs and fit way better than any regular earphones. Feels like hugging the ear tight, and since they don't project out of the ear, it feels pretty balanced and light. Also the wire smoothly adjusts itself, due to around the ear loop design. No fatigue even after a continuous use of 4 hrs. 
Build quality - not as good as other features of this earphone, but definitely at par with a 1.5k earphone, and better than 1k ones.
Amazing product. THANK YOU HeadphoneZone for this!"

379,"Sound quality and clearity is good. You can listen to all the instruments of the song and amazing vocal clearity. Build quality is fine. Comfortable even for long hours. Bass could have been better, therefore you will feel an absence in some songs. Good rock songs."
380,KZ - ZST X
381,"The clarity in the sound is like wow... I am just entering the world of IEM and this product is a best place to start. The only problem I had was it couldn't be worn for a long time, say more than 3-4 hours because of the size. Best IEMs at this budget... I wish I knew this before"
382,KZ - ZST X
383,"KZ has really impressed me with their ZSTXs. Everything about them is simply awesome. The earphones are bright, highs are a bit pronounced but they also produce a very tight bass, which I won't say is exaggerated but just adequate. I have used quite a lot of budget earphones such as the Sennheiser CX180, CX275, Soundmagic e10s/c, JBL endurance run, c200si, t110, t210, Sony's MDR range and also some budget offerings from brands like Jays, Brainwavz and Audio Technica. None of these earphones provide the complete package that the KZs provide. Most of them are just either overly bassy which kinda causes muddying while others try to provide clarity while failing to provide a satisfactory bass response and hence sound flat. 
Now obviously they won't replace very premium iems and earphones in the market, but these do punch much above their weight when we take the cost into consideration. So I guess I would really recommend them. Some other plus points are that they are really very very comfortable and light and at the same time they look really funky as they look really good unlike conventional earphone or even iems do. 
The only downside is that they at times seem to be a tad bit brighter than it is necessary meaning that the highs may sound a bit screechy at high volumes but I wouldn't say that it's a deal breaker."
384,This IEM is for those who want to begin experiencing the immersive audio quality combined with bass.
385,KZ - ZST
386,Good One.
387,Best budget IEM
388,"Let me start by saying headphone zone team did a fantastic job from packaging to delivery. Now the IEM, this is the first IEM i have owned and must say its worth every penny. Its comfortable, nice noise cancellation, you'll be able to hear most of the details easily. Highs are kinda aggressive, with a little tweak in eq you can balance it. Built quality is also good, the wires look fragile though. Overall if you are in a budget and want to experience IEM this is the one you can put your money on."
389,It's my first IEM earphone. Nd it exceeds my expectations. I used sound magic E10C & Sennheiser 275. But this KZ ZSTx was above two in terms sound quality clarity bass response. It's perfect for beginners to explore into IEM Nd u won't disappoint.
390,"I must say these are the best sounding headphone in this cost . They are very comfortable to wear. The mic is also very good.
    The sharpness is high but you can adjust it with your equilizer. The base is not very high but it's more on balance side
    I highly recommend it"
391,KZ - ZST
392,The sound separation and details in the music/movie/series are too good. It has V shaped sound signature.
393,Good instrument segregation and adequate bass
394,KZ - ZST
395,"Firstly, great job on the delivery (delivered under 24hours) even in the present challenging times. Super impressed with the delivery, I would recommend Headphonezone just for their speedy delivery.
I got these after my Sennheiser cx275s (in my opinion the best under 2000Rs) went bad after 3 years of abuse. I have tried IEMs before and I felt it's meant for musicians on stage and not for casual listening besides good ones cost an arm and a leg. These KZ ZST's caught my attention while I was ordering a replacement cx275s and decided to give it a shot after reading a few reviews and small research, in a sentence these particular IEMs offer a very high value in terms of sound quality for the price. 
Pros.
1. Great sound quality for the price, sounds waay better than most premium single driver earphones. 
2. Wide sound stage feels like your listening to live music in a concert. Very good sound seperation, crisp highs and clear mids, can be a little too much to handle at max volume would recommend to use these between 50- 85% volumes.
3. Bass is 'felt' on these not 'forced' like in other earphones, it's hard to describe can only be experienced.
Cons
1. Plastic build and if you're stuck with the flashy purple ones, it looks cheap but it's durable enough.
2. The silicon ear tips are fine, not the best quality ones but can be replaced. The same can be said about the cables too not the best ones but can be replaced easily. 
3. The microphone quality is very mediocre, do not buy this if you make or answer alot of calls. 
4. Although these sound really really good, I don't think it will hold up well for everyday use. Best suited for sparse usage.

Above based on my casual setup - OnePlus 5t, Poweramp player, lossless FLAC audio format only. Genres I listen to from most to least Classic Rock, Hard Rock, Metal, Alternative Metal, Old school Hip-Hop, selective trance/EDM."
396,Cheapest and a must have essential for beginners audiophile.
397,Well balanced sound with perfect loudness levels. Also the bass is perfect i.e. not too high or too low. Fits perfectly into the ear and the nose isolation is pretty good too. Worth every penny. I'm neither an audiophile per se nor a bass head but these are probably the best ones I have had so far. And yes better than the Samsung AKGs that come with the galaxy series.
398,"I am using this earphones for almost more than a week now....I use it with my phone Samsung Galaxy note 8.
Audio is good but only if you listen at 60 to 70 percent of volume after that it becomes too loud and unbearable.
Bass is not punchy and loud but well audible and balanced..
 quite Balanced sound signature....with custom equaliser like I use in spotify can make the audio bit better and more balanced 
Overall good headphones considering the price."
399,"By looking the price u it looks cheap and didnt even think the sound will go great....but its not m,i give a 5star in the sound, build in quality - i dont have to judge base on the price its balance...
overalll   dont judge by the price this inear is beast..."
400,KZ - ZST ek number earphone hai sound bhot mst hai trouble or bass acha hai bas kuch jada hi loud hai. Nice quality
401,"It's been a week of use, and I love these headphones for the crisp sound they provide across the spectrum of instruments. Not bass heavy, which is something I was looking for. The design is as good as it seems in the pictures, and the braided cable is really sturdy and does not seem like it'll give away anytime soon, even with rugged use. Another advantage I feel this has is that you can get the KZ cable separately if you do wear them out (available on Amazon though, not on this site).

402,my phone not use this earphones return request not accept replacement another earphones
403,The best sound i have heard at this price point.
404,"Fastest delivery in my life ever !! 
    Thanks to Headphone Zone Crew and Bluedart 😊
I am using this KZ gem in my Sony mo player... Also in my zoom recorder for my sound projects as monitor, oh yes for general monitoring this can be very well used.  Obviously not like it is in my HD280 Pro, but still, I can hear those fine details even before the proper burn in. Waiting to experience more 😁 and more by time... I would like to try this in a hi res player very soon....❤️❤️"
405,"I am not an audiophile but i could make out the difference from a regular earphone vs the KZ - ZST.. 
Will be a different experience for first time IEM. Bass was not felt in normal equalizer mode.. Since i like bass it was enough when i used a bass equalizer mode.
Also i listen to songs via my LG G7+ THINQ Quad dac which gives a great listening experience from these earphones.
A must have for those who want to explore into IEM segment.

... "
406,Good enough
407,"I'm not an audiophile expert. This is a decent earphone. The mic is decent. The modular design is nice. I can swap out for a bluetooth connector. Couldn't find the connector on headphonezone but there are options on amazon. The audio quality is pretty nice too. I wear this all day taking calls and listening to music. My ears don't hurt at all. I have only used cheap earphones all my life, so this was definitely a step up."
408,"Being a musician and a very skeptical person when it comes to earphones, I should say, never before have I been so satisfied with a pair of earphones. Worth every penny. 
    And also, cheers to headphone zone! This was my first purchase here and, the best in the business and my go-to-place for audio products from now on, nothing more to say :)"

410,Worst service
411,KZ - ZST
412,"Getting a pair of earphones with hybrid (Dynamic + Balanced) drivers at this price point is probably a big deal ! You're getting some generous amount of instrument separation, clarity and wide sound stage for what you pay. Totally worth your money ! My only complaint is, the earphones are a bit towards the shrill side of sound out-of-the-box. That's the only reason me giving it a 4 star. Although it can be handled using an equaliser, it would have been really appreciated if the sound would have been truly balanced. Overall, this set of earphones gives the other ""big brand"" earphones a run for their money ! And hats off to the HeadphoneZone team for delivering the product to me within 2 days of placing order, even during these troubled times !"
413,Crystal clear sound vokal and bass are balance
414,The sound was too sharp and a bit low.
415,KZ - ZST
416,Amazing
417,Sound quality is excellent. Best IEM under Rs.2000
418,Just get a memory foam eartips. You're sorted.
419,They are simply amazing🔥
420,For 1700 bucks its supeb value for these IEMs. KZ is known for its sound quality. This one is no different. Because of their combination of 1dynamic driver and 1 balance armature the sound is great. It has a V sound signature. Pretty powerful and good sound stage. But I feel the V signature is a bit exaggerated. The highs and the lows are a bit exagerated and they kind of over shadow the mids. Im sure most of the people would love them. I personally love a more balanced sound. The wires are good. Mic is good. The eartips are a bit of a let down. But you can easily replace them with foam eartips for better isolation.
421,"It fits comfortably in ear, sound is good , clear bass and highs with acceptable details in mids. Overall value for money. In reasonable price"
422,"Works awesome upto volume level 70-75 %
Beyond that , it is no good."

425,Not satisfied with the quality of wire and there is no voice adjustment at wire.
426,"I have been using RHA-390U since past one year (the most satisfying purchase from HPZ)...At first when i just got KZ ZST i was very excited to check these out and compare with my rha 390u. 
After a week of the usage of kz zst i would like to declare the verdict that rha is the winner of this battle due to reasons like 
1. Lightweight and comfort giving design over heavy and bulky design of kz zst.
2. Indeed the kz zst produces more bass but the problem with them is it pains after few minutes of listening music whereas rha felt comfortable for longtime listening.
3. Vocals, mids, lows all are better in rha than these coz kz zst have an over powering bass.
4.The most important thing to be kept at the time of buying these earpiece (kz zst) is that it doesnt fits every ear size perfectly though it fitted me perfectly but my sister faced the issue with fitting."
427,"I wanted them to be the perfect earphones for me as I really banked on the reviews, no doubt they sound good but since they dont fit perfectly in my ears and I get earaches, I am not able to enjoy them ! Had them burned in for more than 50 hours and listen everyday, but still looking for better options. Sound quality is subjective and buying a pair of headphones or earphones just on other person's review or perspective may not be the perfect way of finding out which suits you better as your personal preferences may differ as in my case !
Still kudos to team Headphone zone for fast delivery. Keep it up."
428,"Amazing headphone. Even more amazing for the price. 
    The Bass and lows are brilliant, separated and well balanced. the sound signature is amazing."
429,"The earphones overall are decent. the sound quality is good. 
    Though plastic used seems a bit on the cheaper side, I would suggest buying memory foam earbuds I didn't like the default one.
    It comes with a one-year warranty if needed the replacement cable is available on this site (be careful while choosing the cable type)  
    But overall I would suggest for you to go for them at this price these are probably the best set to go for."
